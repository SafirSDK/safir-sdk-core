2013-06-25 version 4.4:

This release is intended to implement the "First Step" chapter from the paper "Readonly installation of Safir SDK Core" (https://projekt.consoden.se/safir/job/Whitepapers/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/readonly_install.html).

Add use of configuration (ini) files that allow for configuring some directories that the SDK Core uses to store temporary files during runtime:
  * lock files
  * crash dumps
  * low level logs
Ini file parser supports environment variable and "special variable" (e.g. Windows Known Folders) expansion.
Default configuration puts all files in the "old" locations.

Add "special variable" expansion to dou/dom file parser.

Add ability to specify where dou/dom files should be found (also configured in ini file), which allows for "parameter overlays".

Bugfixes:
  * Ada warning in dots_generated
  * dots_generated shared library loading on Linux
  * static evaluation order bugfix in dots_cpp
  * remove unused function DotsC_BinaryDump
