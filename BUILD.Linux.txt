Linux Build Instructions
========================

We provide pre-built packages for certain linux distributions:
   Ubuntu 14.04 x86
   Ubuntu 14.04 amd64
   Raspbian Jessie (experimental)

If you're using one of these platforms you should probably download the pre-built package
from http://safirsdkcore.com.

Safir SDK Core currently contains packaging instructions for Debian-based distributions,
i.e. to build a deb package. In a future release we will add support for building RPMs.

This document describes how to build a deb package for your Debian-based distribution.

At the end of the document are some hints on how to build Safir SDK Core for other
distributions. If you're still having problems you can contact us at
http://safirsdkcore.com

Installing Prerequisites
------------------------
To install all build dependencies "in one go" run the following from the command line:

  sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper cmake default-jdk asciidoc cli-common-dev \
       libboost-all-dev unixodbc-dev subversion protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev doxygen \
       graphviz qt5-default

If you're building for another Debian-based distribution you may have to adjust some
package names.

Building Safir SDK Core Installation Packages
---------------------------------------------
Now you can build Safir SDK Core using the build script. Open a terminal in the root of
the unpacked source code and run:

  build/build.py --package

After a long wait you should have a set of installation packages in the TODO directory.

If the build script fails you can look in buildlog.html for information about what went
wrong. Please get in touch with us if there is something unexpected in there.

Building on other Linux distributions
-------------------------------------
Safir SDK Core uses CMake as its build system, so to build for any Linux system you
should only need to do

   cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make
   make install

This will build Safir SDK Core with compiler optimizations enabled and then install to
/usr/local. If you wish to control installation directory add -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=...
to the first command.

If you do not have all prerequisites installed you will get warnings and errors from the
cmake command. Some prerequisites are optional and some are required.

When you have installed Safir SDK Core you will have to put some configuration files
under /etc/safir-sdk-core/ or ~/.config/safir-sdk-core/. Find the example configuration
under share/doc/safir-sdk-core, and copy the ini files into your preferred configuration
directory. You may have to adjust the contents of locations.ini to give locations that
are appropriate for your system.

Please get in touch with us if you run into problems!
