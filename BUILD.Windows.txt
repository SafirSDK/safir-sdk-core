Windows Build Instructions
==========================

If you're just looking to install Safir SDK Core, this document is not for you. Download
one of the installers from http://safirsdkcore.com.

This document describes how to set up a computer that can build a Safir SDK Core installer.

Installing Prerequisites
------------------------

Visual Studio 2015 or later (Community or paid versions work, as do Build Tools versions)
Python (>= 3.2)
CMake (>=3.20.0)
Ninja
Qt (>=5.15) *
Java Platform (JDK) *
NSIS (>=3.0) *
Doxygen *
Graphviz *
Conan (>=2.5.0)
Python Websockets
DejaVu Fonts *
Dia *
Asciidoctor *
gzip *

Items marked with an asterisk (*) are optional.

The easiest way to install these prerequisites is using chocolatey (www.chocolatey.org):

   choco install cmake --installargs 'ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System'
   choco install Temurin17 graphviz nsis doxygen.install ninja python3 dejavufonts asciidoctorj dia gzip

Temurin17 is a packaged version OpenJDK 17.

Conan and websockets
--------------------
Safir SDK Core uses conan for downloading some third party code.
For details on what versions are downloaded, see conanfile.py.

So you need to install Conan 2,, which is a C++ package manager we use for some third party
dependencies, and python websockets, which we use for some tests.

  pip3 install "conan>=2.5.0" websockets

We're using a Conan recipe that is not yet updated in the Conan repositories, so that
needs to be installed. Open a terminal in the root of the unpacked Safir SDK Core source
code and run:

  conan export build/qt-advanced-docking-system

Conan and Visual Studio Build Tools
-----------------------------------
If you are using Visual Studio Build Tools instead of the IDE to build Safir SDK Core you
*may* have to add the following two lines to a file called global.conf in the .conan
directory in you home directory (create the file if it does not exist):

  tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:generator=Ninja
  tools.microsoft.msbuild:installation_path=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools

This is needed if you get errors about Conan not finding "Visual Studio 14", for example.

Building Safir SDK Core Installer
---------------------------------
Now you can build Safir SDK Core using the build script. Open a command prompt in the
root of the unpacked source code and run:

  build\build.py --package

After a long wait you should have an installation package in the build/packaging/windows
directory.

If the build script fails you can look in buildlog.html for information about what went
wrong. Please get in touch with us if there is something unexpected in there.
