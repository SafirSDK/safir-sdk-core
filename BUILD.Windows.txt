Windows Build Instructions
==========================

If you're just looking to install Safir SDK Core, this document is not for you. Download
one of the installers from http://safirsdkcore.com.

This document describes how to set up a computer that can build a Safir SDK Core installer.

Installing Prerequisites
------------------------

Visual Studio 2015 or later (Community or paid versions work, as do Build Tools versions)
Python (>= 3.2)
CMake (>=3.20.0)
Ninja
Qt (>=5.15) *
Java Platform (JDK) *
NSIS (>=3.0) *
Doxygen *
Graphviz *
Conan (>=1.44)

Items marked with an asterisk (*) are optional.

The easiest way to install these prerequisites is using chocolatey (www.chocolatey.org):

   choco install cmake --installargs 'ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System'
   choco install Temurin11 graphviz nsis doxygen.install ninja python3 conan

Temurin11 is a packaged version OpenJDK 11.

Conan
-----
Safir SDK Core uses conan (as installed above) for downloading some third party code.
For details on what versions are downloaded, see conanfile.py.

Building Safir SDK Core Installer
---------------------------------
Now you can build Safir SDK Core using the build script. Open a command prompt in the
root of the unpacked source code and run:

  build\build.py --package

After a long wait you should have an installation package in the build/packaging/windows
directory.

If the build script fails you can look in buildlog.html for information about what went
wrong. Please get in touch with us if there is something unexpected in there.
