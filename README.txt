Welcome to the snapshot of Safir SDK Core trunk.

Safir SDK Core is released under the GPL v3 license, a copy of which can be found in COPYING.txt.

Currently the SDK contains build and install instructions for Windows with Visual Studio and Ubuntu 12.04 with GCC.
It is most likely possible to adapt these instructions for other compiler and operating system combinations. The SDK currently supports the x86 and x86_64 platforms.

Please read the INSTALL.Linux.txt document for linux build instructions, and INSTALL.Windows.txt for Windows instructions.

Please post in the forum on http://safir.sourceforge.net/ if you're having any trouble following any of the instructions, or with any other questions.
