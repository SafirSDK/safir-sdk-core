Welcome to the 4.2 release of Safir SDK Core.

Safir SDK Core is released under the GPL v3 license, a copy of which can be found in COPYING.txt.

Currently the SDK contains build and install instructions for Windows with Visual Studio 2005/2008 and various Debian based and RedHat based Linux distributions with GCC.
