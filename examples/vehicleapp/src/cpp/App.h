    * This application is an example of how to use DOB producer mechanisms.
    * The code is written to show the possibilities of the interfaces

    * with VehicleMmi (.Net) or VehicleMmiQt application that implements DOB
    * consumer mechanisms.
    *
    * The application will show how to :
    * 1) Register as handler of entity 'Vehicle' and create, update and delete vehicles
    *    in DOB (shared memory) on create, update and delete requests from users.
    * 2) Handle service request 'CalculateSpeedDifference' and calculate speed difference
    *    and send service response 'CalculateSpeedDifferenceResponse' to service requestors.
    * 3) Use property 'SpeedObjectProperty' to get a property value from an object.
    * 4) Send message 'VehicleMsg'.
