    *
    * The application will show how to :
    * 1) Subscribe for entity 'Vehicle' and display data in a listview and a dialog.
    *    It is possible for the operator to create, update and delete vehicles.
    * 2) Send service request 'CalculateSpeedDifference' to calculate speed difference
    *    and receive servive response 'CalculateSpeedDifferenceResponse' and
    *    present the result in a dialog.
    * 3) Use property 'SpeedObjectProperty' to get a property value from an object.
    * 4) Susbcribe for message 'VehicleMsg' and present recived message text in a dialog.
