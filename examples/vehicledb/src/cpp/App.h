    * This application is an example of how to use the database interface.
    * The application will show how to :
    * 1) Read an entry in a database table.
    * 2) Create or update an entry in a database table.
    * 3) Delete an entry in a database table.
    * The operations are provided as DOB services.
    *
    * This simple example manages vehicle category information stored in
    * a database. Each category is associated with some information.
    * A real world example would probably contain more complex operations.
    *
    * Exception handling, resource handling, recovery handling and SW reporting
    * is omitted or minimized to not obscure the database interfacing.
    * Yet, the necessary exception handling is indicated.
    *
    * The application can be run together with:
    *  - VehicleApp (producer of Vehicle objects).
    *  - VehicleMmi (consumer of vehicle objects and user of the database
    *                services provided by this example).
