Here are instructions for installing on Centos/RHEL 6.x and Ubuntu 12.04.
They can most probably be adapted to other versions as well, but those are the ones that we run our tests on currently. See http://safir.sourceforge.net for more info.

1. Prerequisites

First of all there are a number of packages that you need to have installed on your system to be able to build all the parts of Safir SDK Core.

1.1. Ubuntu
To install these from the command line "in one go" on distributions based on Ubuntu 12.04 run:
   sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev mono-devel mono-gmcs libiodbc2-dev cmake g++ default-jdk doxygen graphviz make python-tk libexpat1-dev autoconf build-essential subversion gnat libboost1.48-all-dev

If you're using a different version you may have to change the version of the boost library (the very last argument above). If in doubt use the latest one that is available in your repositories. If you don't know how to work that out, use libboost-all-dev instead.

1.2. Centos/RHEL
There are a few more steps needed to set up a Centos/RHEL 6.x machine.

1.2.1. Add EPEL repository
Some of the packages we use are not in the default repositories, so you need to add EPEL to your list of repositories. Follow the instructions on http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL.

1.2.2. Install packages
sudo yum install cmake28 boost-devel gcc-c++ doxygen graphviz make expat-devel gcc-gnat tkinter mono-devel java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel qt-devel libiodbc-devel m4 autoconf subversion python-argparse

1.2.3. Set up Mono binfmt_misc
Add "echo ':CLR:M::MZ::/usr/bin/mono:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register" to the end of /etc/rc.local

This allows C# executables to be run directly, like "program.exe" instead of "mono program.exe".

2. Patch Boost

Some Boost versions have bugs that we need to patch to be able to run correctly.

Go into the build/patches directory in the Safir SDK Core source code tree and run "cmake ." followed by a "sudo make install" which will cause the files to be installed into the correct places.

If you're not running a boost version that we support this will fail. Either look at the patches and work out what is needed for your version, or contact us for help in creating the patches for your Boost version.

3. Building

First of all you should decide where you want the SDK installed. You have to specify two environment variables, SAFIR_RUNTIME and SAFIR_SDK.
For example you can create a directory "safir" in your home directory, and set the variables to point to "~/safir/runtime" and "~/safir/sdk" respectively.

There are also a few other variables that you need to set up. Here is an example from my .bashrc:

-------------
export SAFIR_RUNTIME=$HOME/safir/runtime
export SAFIR_SDK=$HOME/safir/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$SAFIR_RUNTIME/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SAFIR_RUNTIME/lib
export ADA_PROJECT_PATH=$SAFIR_SDK/ada
-------------

If you have trouble building java stuff you may also need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. E.g. add "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/" to your .bashrc file.

The easiest way to build Safir SDK Core is to use the build script (a python script that just uses cmake and/or make to build the components and subsystems).
To run the build script go to the directory that contains the build and src directories, and run 
    build/build.py -f build/sdk_core.txt
This will build the Safir SDK Core components in the correct order and install them into the location specified by SAFIR_SDK and SAFIR_RUNTIME.

With a bit of luck you should now have a working Safir SDK Core installed on your computer.

Try starting "dose_main" and "dope_main" and "sate.exe", to see if everything is working.

4. Building example applications
The directory named "examples" contains some test applications. The simplest way to build these is to use the build script with a different configuration file (run after the build of the SDK as described above):
    build/build.py -f build/example_apps.txt
When this is complete you should have a few new applications installed under $SAFIR_RUNTIME/bin: VehicleAppCpp, VehicleAppCs, VehicleMmiCppQt, VehicleMmiCsWinForms and VehicleAppDb. 
Note: There is also a build script configuration file dob_tests.txt, which builds the Dob test suite.

5. Installing runtimes only
If you have built the SDK on one machine and just want to run it on another without installing all the development tools you need to install some libraries and runtimes to get it to run.

5.1 Ubuntu
Run "sudo apt-get install libboost-.*1.48.0 libgnat-4.6 default-jre-headless libmono-corlib2.0-cil libmono-system2.0-cil"

5.2 Centos/RHEL
Add the EPEL repository, as outlined above.
Run "sudo yum install boost mono-core mono-winforms libgnat"
