#IMPORTANT: THIS FILE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED FOR EVERY RELEASE
#Remember: any updates that change APIs should update MAJOR, since
#that is used for SOVERSION.

MAJOR=6
MINOR=0
PATCH=2
SUFFIX=

#Set the SUFFIX to empty string for stable releases (but keep the equal sign).
#if the SUFFIX is used for alpha or beta tags, the first character must be a tilde (~),
#so for example it could be set like this: SUFFIX=~alpha
#The reason for using a tilde instead of a dash is that debian versioning
#wants it that way.

#Note: Keep to 7-bit ascii in this file, or everything will blow up...
