 * TracerDataHeader represents a single tracer message transported between
 * processes.  The header is kept in plain POD members to simplify
 * zero-copy serialisation:
 *
 *   - incarnationId     : unique incarnation identifier of the system the sender belongs to
 *   - senderId          : unique identifier for the sender. Probably just a random number
 *   - sequenceNumber    : monotonically increasing sequence number for
 *                         detecting lost or out-of-order datagrams
 *   - payloadLength     : number of bytes in the user payload that follows the two name strings
 *   - timestampUsec     : wall-clock time when the datagram was produced,
 *                         expressed as micro-seconds since the Unix epoch
 *                         (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970)
 *   - programNameLength : length in bytes (UTF-8) of the program name string, truncated if needed to fit in this field
 *   - nodeNameLength    : length in bytes (UTF-8) of the node name string, truncated if needed to fit in this field
 *
 * Only the fixed-size header is defined here to guarantee the type is a
 * Plain Old Data (POD) object suitable for transmission with e.g.
 * boost::asio::buffer().  The payload bytes must be appended directly
 * after the header when sending over the wire.
