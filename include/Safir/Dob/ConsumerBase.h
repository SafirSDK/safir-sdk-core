     * This Consumer Base class contains callback methods that can be overridden by an entity 
     * handler that registers a handler for an entity type that can potentially be injected 
     * outside the control of the handler itself.
     *
     * Examples of when an entity is injected outside the control of a handler includes
     * persistent data at startup time and entities received from other system installations
     * (multi-owned entities).
     *
     * The handler can reject the injection by invoking Delete for the received entity.
     *
     * In case the handler has no need to be informed when an entity is about to be injected
     * it can rely on the default implementation which just accepts the injected entity.
     *
     * An example of a situation where a handler needs to act on injected data is when the entity
     * has members that are references (EntityIds) to other entity instances, and the lifetime
     * of the pointed-to instance is completly connected to the lifetime of the referer.
     * If an entity has been injected it is the responsibility of the local handler to
     * traverse the entity instance graph, find changed references, and delete the
     * unreferenced entity instances. To support this task there are methods in the InjectedEntityProxy
     * class to read the previous entity state and find invalid refrences.
     *
     * Another example is when an injection relates only to some of the members (might be the case
     * when updates are received from external systems) and the handler wants to maintain some sort
     * of consistency between different members. In this case the handler can call
     * ConnectionAspectPostpone#IncompleteInjectionState to wait for more updates before the new state
     * is set.
