A few of the images in here are created from diagrams in the Enterprise Architect file sug_diagrams.eap.
The process of getting them to the state they're now (png:s) is as follows:

1. Open a diagram in the eap file
2. Choose Diagram->Save Image...
3. Save as a png file
4. Open the png in your favorite editor and crop it to remove the "frame"
5. Save as png

The sequence diagrams are created in a model file that is not publicly available.
