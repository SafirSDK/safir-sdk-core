[appendix]
== Compliance

This section defines how Safir SDK Core complies with its requirements. It lists the
requirements that are not implemented, and sometimes adds an explanation.

=== History

The compliance appendix has its own revision history, to allow the compliance to be
updated without changing an reviewed and approved version of the requirements.

|=========================================================

=== Typical Systems

This section contains some implicit requirements that Safir SDK Core 6.0 is not compliant
with.

All nodes in a system must currently be able to send network packets to each other.

All nodes in a system must have good connectivity. Power failures in the network
equipment is an example of bad connectivity.

All nodes will wait for the slowest node.

=== Distribution

*dist_req_2* has not been tested.

=== Messages with guaranteed delivery

Requirements *mesack_req_1*, *mesack_req_2*, *mesack_req_3*, and *mesack_req_4*, are
currently not implemented in the preferred fashion in Safir SDK Core. The preferred
implementation is described in the ``Messages'' whitepaper that can be found on the Safir
SDK Core Jenkins server at http://safir.sourceforge.net.

However, as is described in that whitepaper it is actually possible to send ``messages''
using +foreach+ and UpdateRequests.

=== Persistence

*pers_req_4* is partially implemented. *pers_req_5* and *pers_req_7* are not implemented.

=== OS, Platform and Compiler support

*plat_req_4* is not complied with since there is no packaging for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.

*plat_req_6* is not implemented.

=== Languages

*lang_req_4* is not implemented. The Ada interfaces have not been updated with the 6.0
changes and are thus not usable.

=== System control and failover support

No *sysctrl_req_* requirements are implemented.

=== Performance

None of the load scenarios have been tested, so none of the *perf_req_* requirements are implemented.
