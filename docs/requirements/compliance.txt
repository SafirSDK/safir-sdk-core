|=========================================================

=== Typical Systems

This section contains some implicit requirements that Safir SDK Core 5.0.1 is not compliant with.

The split/join functionality is rather unreliable, so clients may not loose contact with a server and reconnect automatically in most cases. A server with redundancy that has been disconnected must certainly not be reconnected without a restart.

All nodes in a system must currently be able to send network packets to each other.

All nodes in a system must have good connectivity. Power failures in the network equipment is an example of bad connectivity.

All nodes will wait for the slowest node. 


=== License

*lic_req_2* is not fulfilled, since the User's Guide does not have the correct license.

=== Messages with guaranteed delivery

Requirements *mesack_req_1*, *mesack_req_2*, *mesack_req_3*, and *mesack_req_4*, are currently not implemented in the preferred fashion in Safir SDK Core. The preferred implementation is described in the ``Messages'' whitepaper that can be found on the Safir SDK Core Jenkins server at http://safir.sourceforge.net.

However, as is described in that whitepaper it is actually possible to send ``messages'' using +foreach+ and UpdateRequests.



=== Persistence

*pers_req_4* and *pers_req_5* are partially implemented. *pers_req_7* is not implemented.


=== OS, Platform and Compiler support

*plat_req_1* is not complied with since Ubuntu Precise Pangolin 12.04 is not supported. However, the next LTS release, 14.04 will be supported.

*plat_req_2* is not complied with since RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.x is not supported. However, the next major release RHEL 7 will be supported.

*plat_req_5* is not implemented.

=== System control and failover support

No *sysctrl_req_* requirements are implemented.

=== Performance

None of the load scenarios have been tested, so none of the *perf_req_* requirements are implemented.
