Configure::
The word `configure' in a requirement text implies that there is no need for recompilation in order to make changes available to the system.

Type Extension::
The use of inheritance to define a class with additional members.

Dob::
Distributed Objects, the distribution mechanism of Safir SDK Core that provides distribution of Messages, Services and Entities.

== Background

=== Architecture in systems using Safir SDK Core

A fundamental design tenet of the Safir architecture guidelines is to split or separate a system's functionality into smaller parts, each part being implemented in one application. For example this could mean that a system consists of ten applications that contain only business logic and ten applications that contain only gui. These applications would then use Safir SDK Core data distribution service, the _Dob_, to exchange data in an efficient manner.

Separating functionality into different applications allows a system to be deployed in a flexible manner. All applications could run on a single computer, or they could be spread across several computers, completely transparently to the applications.

This document describes the fundamental mechanisms contained in Safir SDK Core, foremost among which is the data distribution service.

=== Typical systems
This section aims to define some typical systems where Safir SDK Core can be used for inter-process and inter-computer communication. It is meant to give a framework in which to view the requirements that follow in later sections.

These typical systems are only examples, and more kinds of systems and mixtures between these types are also possible.

==== Single computer system
All business logic applications and gui applications run on the same computer and use Safir SDK Core for inter-process communication. There are no requirements for redundancy.

Network topology:: N/A

==== Client/Server system
All business logic applications run on a server, and there are some or many clients that may or may not all be connected at the same time. All the gui applications typically run on the clients.

Clients send no or very little data between each other, the majority of data is sent to and from the server. Clients may loose contact with the server and be allowed to reconnect automatically.

Network topology:: The clients may be situated on the same LAN as the server, but clients may also be on a WAN or on the other side of VPN tunnels. Different clients may have different connectivity to the server, and clients may not be able to send or receive network packets from all other clients.

==== Vehicle mounted Client/Server system

Same configuration as ``Client/Server system'' above, but with two vital differences:

1. One or more clients may intermittently have very bad connectivity, e.g. due to a slip ring.
2. The network may fail intermittently due to power failures.

Network topology:: Everything is situated on the same LAN, but some connections may intermittently be in adegraded state or fail completely.

[[typical_redundant]]
==== Client/Server system with redundancy

As ``Client/Server system'' above, but instead of one server there may be two or more servers with redundancy. This means that when a server fails another server will take over its responsibilities with no or very little delay. The redundant server may provide identical or degraded service to the clients.

A failed server will not be allowed to reconnect to the system until the software on the server is in a state where it will not contaminate the system with out of date or incorrect data.

Network topology:: The servers are expected to have good connectivity between them, even if bandwidth may be low and latency may be high. But network failures between the servers are expected to be few. The servers may be located close to each other on the same LAN or far from each other on a WAN or a VPN.
+
If the connectivity between the servers is bad there will be many redundancy failovers which will cause a lot of network traffic and server reboots.


[[typical_complex]]
==== Complex System with Soft Real-Time requirements

This type of system contains multiple servers with different responsibilities, and all or most of the servers have redundancy. There are many clients, some of which have good connectivity and some that have bad connectivity.

This type of system has a continuous high load of data, the transmission of which requires soft real-time performance. Some of the data is of a transient kind, e.g. data that is updated every second.

Other data in the system has no real-time requirements, but may periodically generate a lot of traffic, e.g. database searches.

As described above in ``Client/Server system with redundancy'' the connectivity between the redundant servers is expected to be good.

One or more of the clients can be placed at a remote location, connected via a WAN or a VPN link.

=== Limitation of Scope

This section attempts to describe some things that Safir SDK Core is _not_. Implicitly it also describes functionality that can be built on top of Safir SDK Core, such as Safir SDK, the commercial product available from Saab AB.

==== System vs System of Systems

A _System_ in Safir SDK Core terms is one or more computers connected by the distribution mechanism of Safir SDK Core, the _Dob_. These computers are able to communicate using the Dob. The Dob has certain expectations about the network environment and topology, for example it expects reasonable connectivity. The Dob does not support Split/Join (se below).

A _System of Systems_ in Safir SDK Core terms is for example a system where multiple vehicles each have a Safir SDK Core system that all communicate with each other over radio, and is resilient to very low bandwidth and frequent communication failures, e.g. due to a radio silent zone.

Safir SDK Core does not provide a mechanism to synchronize between systems, it is only meant for communication within a system. However, it provides some of the building blocks needed to build an inter-system synchronization mechanism.

==== Split/Join

_Split_/_Join_ is a mechanism whereby one or several computers in a system are disconnected from the rest, forming a separate system. At a later time they are reconnected, and _the information sets in the two systems are merged automatically_ to produce one system with a coherent and synchronized information set.

The distribution mechanism in Safir SDK Core is not expected to provide Split/Join functionality. However, the distribution mechanism shall provide the fundamental tools needed to add Split/Join functionality when Safir SDK Core is used to build Systems of Systems.


== Safir SDK Core Requirements

=== License

Safir SDK Core is an Open Source product, however it is also available under a commercial closed-source license from Saab AB.
The GNU licenses that are used are available from https://www.gnu.org/licenses/[].

lic_req_1:: The Safir SDK Core source code shall be made available under the GNU General Public License version 3.
lic_req_2:: The Safir SDK Core documentation shall be made available under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3
lic_req_3:: Third party libraries that are used by Safir SDK Core shall be available under a license that is compatible with GNU General Public License version 3.

Since Safir SDK Core is also available under a closed-source commercial license that allows customers to build proprietary closed-source systems it is important that the third party libraries allow this.

lic_req_4:: Third party libraries that are used by Safir SDK Core shall be available under a license that allows for closed-source distribution of derivative works.

=== Documentation

doc_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall be well documented in a User's Guide.

=== Distribution
The Dob provides three distribution mechanisms; Messages, Services and Entities. These three fulfil different needs in a distributed real time system, and have different characteristics and provide different guarantees.

==== Messages
Messages are data that any application can subscribe to and any application can send. When an application sends a message, it is forwarded to all subscribers of that message.

There are two types of messages; messages that are guaranteed to be delivered and messages that don't have this guarantee. The requirements that are specific for only one of these types are found in the corresponding subsections.

mes_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to send messages that are received by zero or more subscribers.
mes_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to subscribe to messages.
mes_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall guarantee that the message order is kept between sender and receiver.
mes_req_4:: Safir SDK Core shall issue an overflow to the message sender when a message can't be added to the outbound queue.
mes_req_5:: In the case of an overflow Safir SDK Core shall notify the application when it’s possible to start sending messages again.

===== Messages without guaranteed delivery
Messages without guaranteed delivery are typically used for cyclic data where a few lost messages are acceptable. For example, messages can be lost due to network failures or if some application cannot keep up with the message rate. There is no way for the sender to know whether or not a message actually has been delivered.

mesunack_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to send messages without guaranteed delivery.

===== Messages with guaranteed delivery
Messages with guaranteed delivery are used when messages must be delivered to all current subscribers. The sender is informed about the outcome of the send operation, that is, if the message was successfully delivered to all subscribers or if the delivery to one or more subscribers did fail.

mesack_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to send messages with guaranteed delivery.
mesack_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for the message sender to be notified when a message has been successfully delivery to all subscribers.
mesack_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for the message sender to be notified if the message delivery to one or more subscribers did fail.
mesack_req_4:: It shall be possible to configure how long time to wait for responses from all subscribers before notifying the sender.

==== Entities
An entity is a class of which there can be instances that are stored in the Dob. For every entity class there can be several entity handlers. A handler announces its intention to "handle" entity instances of a certain class by making a registration with the class. The handler that creates a particular instance is said to be the owner of that instance. An instance has one (and only one) owner. Only the owner is allowed to modify the instance.

Any application can send a request to create, update or delete an entity instance. A create request must be addressed (by the application) to a specific handler which then accepts or rejects the request.  Create and update requests don't have to be addressed to a handler since an existing instance has a handler (owner) that the request will be directed to.

Any application can subscribe for entity instances, which means that it will receive updates whenever the instances are changed. Entity updates are guaranteed to reach all subscribers, with one important caveat; subscribers are not guaranteed to see all intermediate states of an entity.

ent_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall keep a local object cache with entity instances on each node.
ent_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall keep all local object caches synchronized.
ent_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to register handlers for entity classes.
ent_req_4:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications that has a registered handler to create entity instances of the class.
ent_req_5:: Safir SDK Core shall ensure that an entity instance has one, and only one, owner.
ent_req_6:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for entity owners to update entities.
ent_req_7:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for entity owners to delete entities.
ent_req_8:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to send requests to handlers to create entities.
ent_req_9:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to send update requests for existing entities. The update requests shall be delivered to the entity owner.
ent_req_10:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to send delete requests for existing entities. The delete requests shall be delivered to the entity owner.
ent_req_11:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for entity handlers/owners to send responses to received requests.
ent_req_12:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to subscribe to entity instance creations.
ent_req_13:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to subscribe to entity instance updates.
ent_req_14:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to subscribe to entity instance deletes.
ent_req_15:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to read entity instance states.
ent_req_16:: It shall be possible to configure if entities shall be acknowledged or not. Unacknowledged entities is an optimization that can be used for entities that are cyclically (and frequently) updated

==== Services
A Service has one or more handlers (known as a Service Handlers) to which any application (known as a Requestor) can send service requests. For each service request that is sent, a response is received. The response is sent by the Service Handler, and indicates the result of the operation.

ser_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to register handlers for service classes.
ser_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to send requests to service handlers.
ser_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for service handlers to send responses to received requests.

==== Requests/Responses
The following requirements applies to entity create requests, entity update requests, entity delete requests, service requests and their corresponding responses.

reqrep_req_1:: If a request can not be delivered because there is no registered handler, Safir SDK Core shall generate an error response to the requestor.
reqrep_req_2:: If the receiver of the request does not send a response within a configurable amount of time, Safir SDK Core shall generate an error response (timeout) to the requestor.
reqrep_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall issue an overflow to the requestor when a request can't be added to the outbound queue.
reqrep_req_4:: In the case of an overflow Safir SDK Core shall notify the application when it’s possible to start sending requests again.

==== Handler registration subscriptions
It is possible for applications to subscribe to the registration/unregistration of entity and service handlers. This is useful to be able to monitor the status of other applications in the system.

If a registration goes down and up “very quickly”, the subscriber is guaranteed to get at least one notification that the handler has temporarily been unregistered. Compare that with entity subscribers, who are not guaranteed to get told if an entity is deleted and then recreated immediately

hanreg_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for applications to subscribe to registration and unregistration of entity and service handlers.
hanreg_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall guarantee that a subscriber gets at least one notification when a handler is temporarily unregistered one or more times.

==== Addressing
The addressing mechanism used by Safir SDK Core is completly transparent. The sender of a request or message doesn't know if the receiver is located on the same node or on a remote node.
  
addr_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for requestors to address a handler by a logical name that is completly transparent to where the receiver is located.
addr_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism for message senders to send messages without any knowledge of the location of the subscribers.

==== Queues
For each connection there is a set of associated queues, Outbound request/reply queue, Inbound request/reply queue, Outbound message queue and Inbound message queue.

que_reg_1:: It shall be possible to configure the length of the outbound request/reply queue separately for each connection.
que_req_2:: It shall be possible to configure the length of the inbound request/reply queue separately for each connection.
que_req_3:: It shall be possible to configure the length of the outbound message queue separately for each connection.
que_req_4:: It shall be possible to configure the length of the inbound message queue separately for each connection.

=== Persistence
Persistency services are provided to allow applications to store data persistently in order to survive a restart of the system or an application.

pers_req_1:: It shall be possible to configure entity types to be persistent.
pers_req_2:: Types marked as persistent shall be automatically persisted.
pers_req_3:: Persisted entity instances shall be automatically passed to the handler on startup.
pers_req_4:: It shall be possible to configure persistency services to use a MySQL database for storage.
pers_req_5:: It shall be possible to configure persistency services to use a MariaDb database for storage.
pers_req_6:: It shall be possible to configure persistency services to use a Mimer database for storage.
pers_req_7:: It shall be possible to configure persistency services to use a PostgreSQL database for storage.
pers_req_8:: It shall be possible to configure persistency services to use plain files for storage.

=== Types
Safir SDK Core shall provide a type system that can be used to construct complex types that can be exchanged between nodes and between applications written in various programming languages.

type_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide basic types like integers and floating point values.
type_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall permit creation of user defined enumeration types.
type_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall permit creation of user defined classes consisting of the predefined types and other user defined types.

==== Parameters
A parameter is a name-value pair that can be configured when the system is not started and read during runtime. Parameters cannot be changed during runtime. The value can be of any type that is supported by the type system, both simple types like integers or string and complex user defined types. Parameters can also referee to other parameters of the same type, that is using the same value as another parameter.

par_req_1:: A parameter shall consist of a name and a value.
par_req_2:: All types supported by the type system shall be valid as parameter types.
par_req_3:: An application shall be able to read parameters at runtime.
par_req_4:: It shall be possible to configure a parameter to reference another parameter.

==== Properties
Properties can be explained as interfaces and attributes that can be loosly attached to a class. The class itself has no awareness of what properties it has. Properties may contain members that can be mapped to members in the class or mapped to parameter values.

prop_req_1:: It shall be possible to set properties on classes without recompilation. 
prop_req_2:: Property members shall be possible to map to class members.
prop_req_3:: Property members shall be possible to map to parameters.
prop_req_4:: Properties shall be inherited. That means that if class A has property P, then class B also has property P if B inherits from A.
prop_req_4:: It shall be possible, during runtime, to determine if a class has a specific property.

=== OS, Platform and Compiler support
Safir SDK Core is designed and implemented to be platform and compiler independent, so it is most likely able to support most modern Linux distributions and Windows versions, even if they are not listed in the requirements below.

plat_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall support the latest Ubuntu Long Term Support release, on x86 and x86_64 platforms.
plat_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall support the latest RedHat Enterprise Linux release on x86_64 platforms.
plat_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall support the Windows 7 on x86 and x86_64 platforms.
plat_req_4:: Safir SDK Core shall support Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013.
plat_req_5:: It shall be possible to install the Safir SDK Core software in accordance with the established standard for each supported plattform.

=== Error and event logging
Logging functionality is provided to allow applications to report errors, events and other information. Log timestamps are expected to conform to the format specified by the logging mechanism, e.g. syslog or windows event log, and the timestamp will be based on the local computer clock.

In a system consisting of multiple computers the log timestamps will only be synchronized if the computer clocks are synchronized. Clock synchronization is outside the scope of Safir SDK Core.

log_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a mechanism that allows applications to perform logging.
log_req_2:: The logging mechanism shall be able to send logs to the platform native logging mechanism (e.g. Windows Event Log)
log_req_3:: The logging mechanism shall be able to send logs using the Syslog protocol as defined in RFC3164.
log_req_4:: Logs shall contain timestamp based on the computer clock, category and a log text.
log_req_5:: When running an application it shall be possible to enable and disable application defined logging (i.e. for debugging).

=== Languages
It shall be possible to use Safir SDK Core from different programming languages. Applications written in different languages shall be able to communicate seamlessly.

lang_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall provide programming interfaces in C++.
lang_req_2:: Safir SDK Core shall provide programming interfaces in Java.
lang_req_3:: Safir SDK Core shall provide programming interfaces in .NET.
lang_req_4:: Safir SDK Core shall provide programming interfaces in Ada.

=== System control and redundancy
Node supervision along with redundancy is provided to detect and act on unexpected application or node losses. The system control mechanism starts and stops the entire system including the Dob and will also keep an unambiguous view of the system, i.e which nodes are part of the system and where individual applications are executing.

sys_ctrl_req_1:: It shall be possible to supervise the existence of a node.
sys_ctrl_req_2:: It shall be possible to automatically restart a node after an uncontrolled stop. 
sys_ctrl_req_3:: It shall be possible to define a fallback system configuration as an addition to the basic system configuration. The fallback system configuration shall be automatically switched to when the basic configuration fails.
sys_ctrl_req_4:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a start mechanism that starts the system.
sys_ctrl_req_5:: Safir SDK Core shall provide a stop mechanism that stops the system.
sys_ctrl_req_6:: The start/stop mechanism shall be configurable to start external applications that is not part of Safir SDK Core.
sys_ctrl_req_7:: The start/stop mechanism shall be able start and stop applications on any node in the system.
sys_ctrl_req_8:: The control mechanism shall provide an unambiguous view of wich nodes are part of the system.
sys_ctrl_req_9:: The start/stop mechanism shall monitor the processes started through it.

=== Context
The concept of contexts in Safir SDK Core is a mechanism for separation of data into different realms that can exist simultanously but are strictly separated from each other. For example the same instance of an object may occur in more than one context at the same time, and the Dob will guarantee that they will never be mixed up. 

Common usages of contexts are simulated data and replay of recorded data. By defining a special simulation context, there is no risk that simulated data for educational purposes are mixed up with real data, and the same applies to replayed data.

context_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall support separation of information into different contexts.
context_req_2:: An application that is connected to the Dob in one context shall not be able to access data from other contexts.

=== Performance

Instead of providing a set of requirements for the exact performance that the distribution mechanism of Safir SDK Core shall provide this section describes a few different load scenarios.

perf_req_1:: Safir SDK Core shall be able to handle the load scenarios described below.
perf_req_2:: The load scenario tests shall be performed on the following platforms:
             * Windows 7 x86_64 and Visual Studio 2013
             * Latest Ubuntu Long Term Support release on x86_64

Since computer hardware is developing at a rapid pace it is not sensible to specify exactly which hardware the scenarios should be run on. Instead these scenarios are expected to be tested on "reasonably new and powerful" hardware:

* Midrange Intel x86_64 processor less than two years old.
* At least 4Gb RAM installed.
* Midrange harddrive that is less than two years old.
* Nothing except the operating system running on the computer.

These specifications apply to all computers in the load scenarios, except where otherwise noted.

perf_req_2:: For all major and minor releases (e.g. 5.0 and 5.1, but not 5.1.1) results from running these scenarios shall be documented and made available to customers and potential customers.  

perf_req3:: The documented results shall contain at least the following:
* Hardware specifications of test platform
* Software versions used (e.g. operating system and dependencies)
* Latency statistics
* Loss statistics for unacknowledged data
* Maximum achieved throughput
* Average CPU load

Some definitions needed for the scenarios:

+CyclicEntity+:: An entity with ten members, with a serialized size of less than 150 bytes. This entity shall be sent without acknowledgements over the network.

+StaticEntity+:: An entity with 40 members, with a serialized size of around 3000 bytes. This entity shall be sent with acknowledgements over the network.

+CyclicMessage+:: A message with 200 members, with a serialized size of around 4000 bytes. This message shall be sent without guaranteed delivery.

+ReqResp+:: A service with a small request size (5 members, serialized size around 100 bytes) and a large response size (20 members, serialized size around 50Kb).

==== Load Scenario 1

This scenario is intended to be an approximate instantiation of the typical system described in <<typical_complex>>.

* 20 computers with equivalent hardware, each running one node.
* Node A owns 1000 instances of +CyclicEntity+, each updated at 1Hz.
* Node A owns 1000 instances of +StaticEntity+, with twenty random instances being updated every second.
* Node B owns 4000 instances of +CyclicEntity+, each updated at 0.1Hz.
* Node B owns 4000 instances of +StaticEntity+, with twenty random instances being updated every second.
* Node C and D each produce 500 +CyclicMessage+ per second.
* Node E handles +ReqResp+ requests.
* 15 nodes each produce 10 update requests per second on random +StaticEntity+ instances.
* 15 nodes each produce 10 +ReqResp+ requests per second.
* All nodes subscribe to all entity updates.

==== Load Scenario 2

This scenario is intended to be an approximate instantiation of the typical system described in <<typical_redundant>>.

* 2 computers each running one ``Server'' node.
* Server A own 10000 instances of +StaticEntity+, with 100 random instances being updated every second.
* Server B subscribes to all entities.
* 100 ``Client'' nodes that may be slower (either due to slower network connection or slower hardware) than the two servers. 
* All client nodes subscribe to all entities
* All client nodes each produce 1 update request per second on random +StaticEntity+ instances.
* Every minute one random client node restarts.
* The network shall have a component connected that introduces errors into the the network traffic, e.g. by discarding packets and changing packet order.

Multiple client nodes may run on the same hardware, e.g. through virtualization. The clients may also be run on a cloud hosting service, to reduce the need for purchasing dedicated hardware.
