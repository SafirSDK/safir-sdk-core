Safir SDK Core Users Guide
==========================
Lars Hagström <lars.hagstrom@saabgroup.com>
Version 1.0, Feb 2009

== Preface
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive guide to using the services in Safir SDK Core version 3.2. The reader should have general knowledge about object-oriented programming. Some knowledge of distributed real-time systems programming is also desirable, but not essential.

=== How to read
This document is intended to be used both as an introduction to new users of the Safir SDK Core, and as a reference for those who have used the SDK for a long time. Because of this the level of the different sections vary quite a lot. Some sections are marked as advanced (with an ^adv^ tag to them), to signal that they cover advanced topics that can be skipped by "beginners".

=== Acknowledgements
This document is a combination of several other documents, so some parts of the text have different authors, or is based on texts authored by other people. 

More specifically the database section is written by Jörgen Johansson, the software error reporting was originally written by Anders Widén and the section on Safir.Utilities.Foreach was written by Stefan Lindström. Most of the text on the basic Dob services is based on the original Dob Software Users Guide written by Jörgen Johansson.

This document has also been reviewed by a number of people: Henrik Sundberg, Mattias Gålnander and Anders Widén. If I've left someone out, then I apologise and I'll happily add you.

== What is Safir SDK Core?

This section is meant to contain a high-level overview of what the Safir SDK Core is, what services it provides and what kind of systems it is suitable for, without going too much into the technical details. 

But, we're not there yet. Due to time constraints we haven't been able to get that information in here in a form that we're satisfied with. If you want that kind of information please contact Saab AB (contact information at http://www.safirsdk.com[]).

So for the time being this chapter just contains a collection of background information. 

=== Provided services
Safir SDK Core is mainly aimed at providing a data distribution for distributed real-time systems and information systems, but there are a few other services included in Safir SDK Core, mostly because they are needed internally. <<sdk_service_summary>> contains a summary of the services provided by Safir SDK Core.

Safir SDK Core consists of a number of _components_, that have cryptic four-letter acronyms as names. Each component provides one or more services. This document tries not to use the cryptic acronyms, but rather talks about the services provided, but it is good to know about them.

[[sdk_service_summary]]

When we talk about _the Dob_ what is really meant is the services provided by Dots, Dose and Dope, i.e. distributed objects with optional persistence.

Component dependencies are illustrated in <<sdk_core_component_dependencies>>.

Again, to be able to use Safir SDK Core you do not need to understand or like these acronyms, but knowing that they are there may make some things in the SDK easier to use.

=== Why ``Core''?
Saab sells another product Safir SDK, which is not open-source, which consists of Safir SDK Core plus a number of services that are very useful when building systems for both the civil and military market.

The additional services that Safir SDK provides include Alert handling, Application and Node redundancy control, communication over low-bandwidth and low connectivity media (e.g. radios of different kinds), track handling and correlation etc. 

Contact Saab AB for more information (contact information at http://www.safirsdk.com[]).

=== Prerequisites / Dependencies
Safir SDK Core uses two open-source products to provide low level functionality and operating system independence wrappers.

*ACE*, The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment, a freely available, open-source, C\+\+ network programming toolkit. See http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html[] for more information. At Saab we are is using 5.6.3 and later, but Safir SDK Core is quite likely to work with earlier versions.

*Boost*, a collection of portable high-quality C\+\+ libraries. See http://www.boost.org/[] for more information. Safir SDK Core requires boost version 1.36 or later (it is possible to use 1.35 by patching a few bugs, or 1.34 by installing the Boost.Interprocess library separately).

=== Supported Platforms
Safir SDK Core supports both the Windows and Linux platforms on the x86 platform. It also supports Linux on 64 bit x86_64 platforms, but this has not been extensively tested. It should work well on 64 bit Windows platforms as well.

Obviously it is possible to combine all these platforms into one system and use Safir SDK Core for communication (after all what use is a middleware if it isn't platform independent).

An application should, written correctly using ACE and Boost and Safir SDK, be portable to all the supported platforms with no or very little effort.

The compilers that are used for the C\+\+ code are GNU gcc (version 4.0 or later) or Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SP1. For C# code we use Visual Studio 2005 SP1 or Mono (version 1.9.1 or later).

== What is the Dob?
This chapter describes what the Dob does and a little bit about why it does it the way it does.

=== What does the Dob do?
The Dob provides several distribution mechanisms needed to create distributed real-time systems. It is possible to interface with the Dob from several languages (currently C\+\+, C#, with Ada, and Java support being re-added in Sdk version 3.2.2).

The main ``selling points'' include:
- Completely transparent addressing on single or multi-node systems.
- Supports _both_ request/response and publish/subscribe idioms.
- Easy-to-use Persistency.
- Redundancy and hot-standby.
- Language independent inter-process/inter-computer communication.
- Allows modular information model.
==== A bit about the Dob architecture

The Dob consists of two parts that together provide the object distribution mechanism. These two parts are the type system (Dots), which provides the language independent types and manages the definitions of the objects to distribute, and the distribution mechanism (Dose), which does the actual data distribution and synchronisation.

To use the Dob an application includes the language specific interface part of the Dob interface into the application. This language specific interface in turn uses language independent libraries (written in C\+\+) to manage the objects and to communicate with other parts of the Dob.

To run the Dob there is an executable, "dose_main", that must be running. This executable is responsible for managing the distribution of data between applications and nodes in the system.

Within a node all data distribution is done through shared memory, and between the nodes it is UDP/IP communication (with a reliable protocol on top, to guarantee delivery). 

=== Which problem does the Dob solves?

The Dob is appropriate for distribution of data between applications (in the same, or another, computer) in real-time and information systems, since it:

- Has no infinite queues.
- Is event driven (no polling).
- Is asynchronous (no RPC, no blocking calls).
- Has a bounded latency.

The Dob implements a distributed cache, making it possible to either read information synchronously from shared memory, or to subscribe to object changes.

The Dob supports Windows and Linux, allowing computers running different operating systems to communicate transparently.

=== Quick intro

The Dob provides three distribution mechanisms; Messages, Services and Entities. These three fulfil different needs in a distributed real time system, and have different characteristics and provide different guarantees.

This section describes these, and then goes on to describe how the objects are defined.

==== Messages
Messages are data that any application can subscribe to and any application can send. Messages do not have owners in any useful sense. When an application sends a message, the Dob forwards it to all subscribers of that message. 

No record is kept of messages, i.e. they are not stored in the Dob in any way. So once the message has been sent there is no way of getting hold of it again.

Messages do not have guaranteed delivery. If some application cannot keep up with the rate of messages it will miss messages. If you need guaranteed delivery, messages are not what you are looking for.

==== Services
A Service has one or more handlers (known as a Service Handler) to which any application (known as a Requestor) can send service requests. For each service request sent a response is received. The response is sent by the Service Handler, and should indicate the result of the operation (i.e. success or failure, with or without result data). If the service handler does not send a response within a reasonable amount of time (configurable, see <<request_timeouts>>), the Dob will send a timeout response to the requestor.

Service requests and responses are guaranteed to be delivered. And you are guaranteed a response if you have sent a request.

==== Entities
An entity is a _class_ of which there can be objects (known as instances) that are stored in the Dob and has one (and only one) owner. Only the owner is allowed to modify the object. Any application can subscribe for a entity instances, which means that it will receive updates whenever the instances are changed. Applications can also send requests (very similar to the service requests above) to the entity owner asking it to change something in the object.

Entity requests and responses are guaranteed to be delivered. And you are guaranteed a response if you have sent a request. Entity updates are guaranteed to reach all subscribers, with one important caveat; subscribers are not guaranteed to see all intermediate states of an entity. E.g. if an application misses one update the next update will look as if both things changed at once.

==== Defining the information model
The Dob allows each application/component that wants to provide a Dob interface (as in a Service, Message or Entity that other applications/components can use) to contribute to the information model by specifying its objects in xml files, which are built into the information model.

The xml files are used to generate language interfaces, that any application that wishes to use an object can include and use.

[[information_model]]
.Defining the information model
image::images/typesystem_information_model.jpg["Defining the information model", width=400]

The figure <<information_model>> attempts to show how applications contribute to, or partake of, the information model. 

===== Defining objects
New types are defined by inheritance from a number of predefined classes. The classes for the distribution mechanisms are Safir.Dob.Message, Safir.Dob.Service, Safir.Dob.Entity, Safir.Dob.SuccessResponse and Safir.Dob.ErrorResponse.

All classes are defined off-line using xml in a file called a _dou_-file (named after its extension; ".dou"). These dou-files are then used to generate and compile language specific interfaces to that specific class. Applications use these generated interfaces for operating on the objects. 

The dou-files are also used by the Dob to create binary chunks (usually called _blobs_) from the classes that can be sent to other nodes over a network. The dou-file information is of course also needed to interpret these blobs. The dou-files can also contain parameters for the applications. These parameters are read by the Dob at start-up, so no recompilation is required for parameter changes.

When a member is added to an object it is only necessary to regenerate/recompile the interface, and not the applications that use it. An application that is built against a previous version of the object will still work correctly (although it, of course, is unaware of the new member).

Here is an example of a dou-file for a simple entity (containing one 32-bit integer):

.A simple dou-file
[xml]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<class xmlns="urn:safir-dots-unit" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

  <baseClass>Safir.Dob.Entity</baseClass>
  <members><member>
    <name>TheNumber</name>
    <type>Int32</type>
  </member></members>
</class>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is described in greater detail in the next chapter.

== The type system
One "half" of the Dob consists of a type system that is used to describe and manage the types in the Dob. This is needed to be able to create objects that are language inter-operable and to have types that it is possible to use in heterogeneous systems (e.g different nodes having different processor architectures and operating systems).

All Safir systems are based around types defined using the Dob type system. 

A Dob object is made up of _members_, that can be simple or complex types (and arrays of these).

The type system also provides functionality for defining run-time parameters (values are loaded at start-up) and properties, that provide a common interface for accessing members of different classes.

=== The simple types 
These are the simple types that class members can have, either as single members or as arrays (it is also possible to put objects inside objects, which is described below). 

.The simple Dob type system types.
`------------`---------------------------------------------------------------------
Type         Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boolean      As defined in each supported language.
Enumeration  Routines for conversion to/from strings are generated.
Int32        4 byte signed integer.
Int64        8 byte signed integer.
Float32      4 byte floating point value.
Float64      8 byte floating point value.
TypeId       Reference to a Dob class or enumeration.
ChannelId    A Message channel identifier (see <<hashed_types>>).
HandlerId    A Service or Entity handler identifier (see <<hashed_types>>)
InstanceId   An Entity instance identifier (see <<hashed_types>>).
EntityId     An aggregate of a TypeId and an InstanceId. A reference to an Entity instance
String       Unicode string. Size is defined in number of Unicode characters.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== SI Types 
The Dob type system also has definitions for the SI units. This makes it easier to specify what values are expected in objects. If a member is called "Angle" it should have a type of Radian32; this makes it easy for object users to know what to expect from the member. If it had been defined as a Float32 the users would have to find out from somewhere else what the expected contents are supposed to be; should there be radians, degrees, gons or mils in there?

The SI unit types are all based on Float32 or Float64 respectively:

.Types for SI units.

-------------------------------------------------------

[[hashed_types]]
==== Hashed types
The InstanceId, ChannelId and HandlerId types are hashed types. They can be defined either as a string or as a number. If defined as a number the number will be used as the value, but if defined by a string, the string is hashed and the hash is used as the value. 

If a string is used to define hashed type, the string will be included in the type, but is only meant to be used for reference (the hash value is used for all built-in operations). There is a method on all the hashed types, +RemoveString+, that removes the string to save space/bandwidth.

[[member_flags]]
=== Flags on members

Each member inside a Dob object has two flags associated with it. One _IsNull_ flag and one _IsChanged_ flag. The purpose of the IsNull flag is to allow all members to, apart from their normal values, have a state where they're not set or unknown. The IsChanged-flag allows the Dob and applications to signal _intent as well as content_ when transmitting data, for example indicating what has changed in an entity between two subscription responses.

All members have methods to access these flags, +IsNull+ and +IsChanged+, and the flags can be manipulated using the +SetChanged+ and +SetNull+ methods.

The change flags are described in greater detail in <<change_flags>> and <<interpreting_change_flags>>.

[[items_and_structs]]
=== Items and structs 
Apart from simple types, such as integers and strings, classes can also contain other classes. These "contained classes" are usually called _Items_ (due to the fact that they should inherit from Safir.Dob.Item).

An Item works exactly the same way as any other Dob class apart from the fact that it is not possible to send it to another application without putting it inside an object that is distributable (i.e. a Message, Entity, Service or Response). An item has change flags and null flags just like any other member, and all of the item's members have change flags and null flags too.

All these flags mean that there is a certain overhead to items, which in many cases is undesirable. And also, it doesn't always make sense to have null and change flags on all members of items. For example, in a Position type, there is no point in setting the Latitude member to null. Either the position as a whole is null or it is a valid position. For this purpose _Structs_ (inheriting from Safir.Dob.Struct) were introduced. Currently they behave exactly like an Item, but in a future Dob version they will be optimised so as to remove all the flags and overhead. 

This means that there are some limitations to what you should do to a Struct. Do not use IsChanged or IsNull on any struct members. Do not inherit from a user-defined struct (structs will not support inheritance). In the current Dob this will of course work, but once the optimisation is introduced your code will break.

[[parameters]]
=== Parameters 
Apart from members a class can also contain constant parameters. These parameters are not compile-time constants, instead they are read from the dou-files by the Dob when it starts and applications can ask for the values by a simple function call. This means that all that is needed to change a parameter is to change its value in the dou file (under $(SAFIR_RUNTIME)/data/text/dots/classes/) and restarting the Dob and all the applications that use the Dob (note that running +make+ in dots_generated as described below will overwrite these changes).

Parameters are defined by a name, a type and a value. Here is an example of a parameter definition (it is cut out of its context, but it goes in the dou-file at the same level as the _members_-tag).

.A parameter definition
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<class xmlns="urn:safir-dots-unit" 
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <summary>An example parameter file.</summary>
    <name>Capabilities.MyParameters</name>
    <baseClass>Safir.Dob.Parametrization</baseClass>
    <parameters>
        <parameter>
            <name>MyParameter</name>
            <type>Int32</type>
            <value>25</value>
        </parameter>
    </parameters>
</class>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This defines a parameter MyParameter that is a 32 bit integer of value 25.

It is recommended to keep most parameters in pure parameter classes, suffixed Parameters, that inherit from Safir.Dob.Parametrization. These classes should not contain any members. The reason for this is to make it easier to know where parameters can be found. The Dob does not enforce this recommendation in any way.

[[environment_parameters]]
==== Environment variables in parameters
For parameters it is also possible to use environment variables in the parameter value. (In the 3.2 and earlier releases of Safir SDK Core it is only possible to use them in string parameters, but for later releases, including 3.2.1, it is possible to use them in all kinds of parameters.)

The syntax for environment variables is +$(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME)+, and there can be several environment variables in one parameter. An example use is shown below.

.Environment variable in parameter.
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<parameter>
    <name>MyParameterWithEnv</name>
    <type>String</type>
    <value>Safir SDK Core runtime is located 
           in $(SAFIR_RUNTIME), and the sdk in $(SAFIR_SDK)</value>
</parameter>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember that all parameters are loaded 'when the first application that uses parameters starts', so any environment variables set after that time will not be seen by the type system environment variable expansion.

=== Create routines 
Create routines allow the designer of a Dob class to define custom routines for creating _commonly used_ instances of that class.

Create routines are similar to constructors. The members to be given as parameters to the routine, and those to be fetched from parameter definitions are defined. For example: 

.A create routine definition.
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<createRoutines>
    <createRoutine>
        <summary>Create a position with dummy altitude.</summary>
        <name>Position</name>
        <parameters>
            <member>Latitude</member>
            <member>Longitude</member>
        </parameters>
        <values>
            <value>
                <member>Altitude</member>
                <parameter>Safir.Geodesy.Position.DummyAltitude</parameter>
            </value>
        </values>
    </createRoutine>
</createRoutines>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Will result in generated code like:

.Generated C\+\+ create routine
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * Create a position with dummy altitude.
 */
static PositionPtr CreatePosition
    (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::Si64::Radian Latitude,
     const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::Si64::Radian Longitude);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the +CreatePosition+ method will allow the user to create a two-dimensional Position object using only one line of code, instead of having to first create the object, and then set the three members to correct values (Position is a Struct, so it doesn't have the null flag for its members, hence the dummy position is used to signal that it is a two-dimensional position).

The Altitude member will be set to the value specified in the +Safir.Geodesy.Position.DummyAltitude+ member.

The Position class also supplies a create routine for a three-dimensional position, but the two-dimensional one is a better example, since it uses a parameter.

(The Position class is part of the Geodesy component that Saab is releasing under an Open Source license. Geodesy is not part of Safir SDK Core, but it will be available for download from http://www.safirsdk.com[].)

=== The syntax - putting it all together
As mentioned above classes are defined by creating an Xml-file called a dou-file. The dou-file describes the class and is used to generate the interface code used by the components to interface the Dob. All dou-files have two mandatory fields that describe the name of the class and its base class. The _name_ field contains both the name of class and the namespace the class is located in, and the _baseClass_ field contains the base class (and its namespace) to inherit from.

In the example below the name is Vehicle and the Vehicle class is located in the namespace Vehicles which is located in the namespace Capabilities. The class is referenced by other classes as Capabilities.Vehicles.Vehicle. The Vehicle class is an Entity (that resides in the Safir.Dob namespace).

.Start of a dou-file class declaration
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<class xmlns="urn:safir-dots-unit" 
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <summary>Definition of vehicle entity</summary>   
    <name>Capabilities.Vehicles.Vehicle</name>
    <baseClass>Safir.Dob.Entity</baseClass>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.A note on namespaces
*****************************
The top-level namespace _Safir_ is reserved for Dob classes belonging to Safir and shall not be used for classes not belonging to Safir. 

One of the main purposes of Safir SDK is to promote reusable code. Due to this Saab recommends *not* using project names as top-level namespaces (or indeed any part of the namespace), since this will cause problems when reusing those components in another project.

Saab uses _Capabilities_ as the top-level namespace for reusable components built on Safir. Non-top-level namespaces should not be component or project specific names but rather service oriented names describing the functionality of the classes in that namespace. As an example the class +Capabilities.Vehicles.Vehicle+ is a class in a reusable component for handling vehicles. 
*****************************

Arrays are declared by adding the field arraySize to an element or constant as shown in the example below.

.Array member declaration
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <member>
        <name>Type</name>
        <arraySize>10</arraySize>
        <type>Int32</type>
    </member>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For strings the maximum length in number of Unicode characters must be defined using the maxLength tag.

.String member declaration
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <member>
        <name>Callsign</name>
        <type>String</type>
        <maxLength>10</maxLength>
    </member>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The string lengths and array sizes can be specified with parameters as well. The tags used for this is arraySizeRef and maxLenghtRef, and the parameter name must be fully qualified (full namespace and class name).

.Parameters and members
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <parameters>
        <parameter>

        </parameter>
        <parameter>
            <name>StringLength</name>
            <type>Int32</type>
            <value>10</value>
        </parameter>
    </parameters>

            <type>Int32</type>
        </member>
        <member>
            <name>Callsign</name>
            <type>String</type>

                Capabilities.Vehicles.Vehicle.StringLength
            </maxLengthRef>
        </member>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Of course, as mentioned in <<parameters>> it is recommended that parameters are placed in separate parameter classes.

It is possible - indeed it is even recommended - to add comments to most fields in dou-files. These comments will be put into the generated code where they be made into _doxygen_ comments (for C\+\+) or provide "intellisense" information (C#) for IDEs that support it.

=== Properties^adv^
A property is not an object on its own. It is merely an interface into other objects. The way that a property interfaces into an object is defined at start-up, _so it is possible to change the way the interface works without recompiling any applications._

The interface itself is specified in a dou-file which is slightly different from class definitions.

.A simple property (NamedObject)
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<property xmlns="urn:safir-dots-unit" 
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <name>Safir.NamedObject</name>
    <members>
        <member>
            <name>Name</name>
            <type>String</type>
        </member>
    </members>
</property>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to create a _dom_-file (has .dom as its extension) to define to which object member the property member is mapped.

.A NamedObject mapping for Vehicle
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<propertyMapping xmlns="urn:safir-obj" 
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <property>Safir.NamedObject</property>
    <class>Capabilties.Vehicles.Vehicle</class>
    <memberMapping>
        <member>
            <propertyMember>Name</propertyMembert>
            <classMemberReference>
                <classMember>Callsign</classMember>
            </classMemberReference>
        </member>
    </memberMapping>
</propertyMapping>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mapping above specifies that the member Name in the NamedObject property is mapped to the Callsign member of the Vehicle object.

It is also possible to map property members to values (either to direct values or to references to parameters) or to null.

.Property mapping to value or parameter
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <member>
        <propertyMember>Int32Member</propertyMember>
        <value>10</value>
    </member>
    <member>
        <propertyMember>Int64Member</propertyMember>
        <valueRef>Safir.UnitParameters.SomeParameter</valueRef>
    </member>
    <member>
        <propertyMember>NullMember</propertyMember>
    </member>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is even possible to map to members that reside inside an item array inside the mapped class.

.Property mapping into an array
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <member>
        <propertyMember>Int64Member</propertyMember>
        <classMemberReference>
            <classMember>ItemArrayMember</classMember>
            <index>2</index>
            <classMemberReference>
                <classMember>TheMemberIWanted</classMember>
            </classMemberReference>
        </classMemberReference>
    </member>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And so on...


All fields in the property have to be mapped to something (i.e. a member, parameter or to null) to be a complete mapping. Dom-files have to be named "<mapped class name>-<property name>.dom", e.g. "Capabilties.Vehicles.Vehicle-Safir.NamedObject.dom".

It is possible to use properties on any kind of object except Structs. So the same property could be mapped into an item, an entity, a service and a response.

.Properties are inherited
*****************
Property mappings are inherited, so, for example, any class that inherits from Safir.Vehicles.Vehicle will inherit the property mapping defined above. The derived class can override the inherited property mapping by supplying its own mapping.
*****************

==== Using the property
To use the property you need to have an object of a type that is mapped to it. For example you could have set up a subscription to Capabilities.Vehicles.Vehicle (which is mapped to the NamedObject property). 

.Using a property
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void DisplayName(const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::ObjectPtr & obj)
{
    const std::wstring name = Safir::NamedObject::GetName(obj);
    ... display the name ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that in the code above there is no reference at all to what kind of object +obj+ is. It could be any object that has the property mapped to it. It is possible to check if an object has a specific property mapped to it using the +HasProperty+ method on the property.

=== Generating code from Dou-files
In order to use the classes defined by the Dou-file, interface code has to be generated in the wanted language. This code generation is performed by a tool called Dots_V. When the code is generated it has to be built into loadable libraries (e.g. dlls, shared libraries, or assemblies). 

The generated code gets put in subdirectories under $(SAFIR_SDK)/dots/dots_generated (e.g. cpp/ dotnet/ etc). This code is built by the Makefile and put into loadable libraries (e.g. dots_generated-cpp.dll) that are copied to the $(SAFIR_RUNTIME)/bin directory. The C\+\+ header files are also copied to the $(SAFIR_SDK)/include directory so that they are available to include into your code.

This is done slightly differently on Windows and Linux:

*Windows*

There is a Makefile provided under %SAFIR_SDK%/dots/dots_generated (a make executable is distributed with the sdk), so open a command prompt in that directory and run "make". This will only generate and build code for the dou-files that have changed since the last time make was run. 

Since the Makefile currently isn't very good at working out dependencies you may have to run "make clean rebuild" (or the alias "make my day") to get all source files regenerated and rebuilt.

_If you experience strangeness (e.g. corrupted data) when using the Dob objects, always run "make clean rebuild" before asking for help!_

*Linux*

There is a CMake file (you're required to have at least CMake version 2.4 installed) provided under $SAFIR_SDK/dots/dots_generated, so open a terminal in that directory. Then do

1. Run "cmake ." - note the period, for the directory where to run cmake. (This step is only needed if you've added or removed any files)
2. Run "make"
3. Run "make install" if the make step was successful
(Of course you can do all this at once by running "cmake . && make install")

If you experience problems you can do a "make clean" and start over again. Remember that you can use the -jN flag to speed up compilation, so a "make -j3" might be a bit quicker than just a "make".

=== Using the generated types
This section contains some pointers on how to use the generated types, and what the different operations and classes "mean".

For the examples in this section we need a couple of Dob-class definitions:
B is an item (a Dob-object to use inside other objects) which contains an Int64, called MyInt. A is a Dob-Object (could be an Entity, Service, Message or Response) that contains one B, called MyB and one Float32 called MyFloat.
So an A object (myA) could look like in <<example_object>>.

==== A bit of history 
First a little bit of history (that you can skip if you want to), among other things to explain what _Real Classes_ mean.

In the first versions of the Dob all objects in all languages were stored internally as binary _blobs_ which only the Dob knows how to interpret. Calling a method to get an integer out of an object meant that the Dob would work out where in this blob the integer was stored and then cast the binary chunk into an integer and return it.

The advantage of this approach is that binary the blobs are language independent and also very good for sending across a network.

There are many drawbacks to this approach, one of them being that objects do not behave like normal objects for that language, so the interfaces were changed to make objects behave like real objects, or real classes (hence the name _Real Classes_). These objects would be translated to blobs before being passed into the core of the Dob, so that the Dob can still work with several languages and be network efficient.

Using "Real Classes" mean a few things (compared with using the old blob-based implementations):

1. Easier to debug (you can see member values in the debugger instead of just a blob)
2. Easier handling of nested classes
3. Better performance while handling nested classes.

Originally only the C\+\+ and C# interfaces were updated to use Real Classes, and the Java and Ada interfaces were left for later. When the new features of global object id's, injections and handlers were introduced it was decided not to update the old interfaces, but rather to update the Java and Ada interfaces with Real Classes as well, at the same time. Unfortunately this has not yet been done (will be done as part of Sdk 3.2.2), so there is currently no support at all for Ada and Java.

==== Syntax in the different languages
One part of the Real Classes idiom is to make use of the language's own features in the best possible way. Languages that support operator overloading should use them if it makes the interface "better", and languages that support properties should use them. This makes each language interface "as good as it can possibly be", but it has one obvious side effect, i.e. the interfaces are not "identical".

<<top_level_syntax>> compares the operations in C\+\+ and C# on top-level members.

[[top_level_syntax]]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get MyFloat out of myA,         +myA.MyFloat()+ or +myA.MyFloat().GetVal()+,             +myA.MyFloat.Val+
Set MyFloat in myA to 3.14,     +myA.MyFloat()=3.14+ or +myA.MyFloat(). SetVal(3.14)+,   +myA.MyFloat.Val=3.14+
Check if MyFloat is null,       +myA.MyFloat().IsNull()+,                                +myA.MyFloat.IsNull()+
Check if MyFloat is changed,    +myA.MyFloat(). IsChanged()+,                            +myA.MyFloat.IsChanged()+
Set MyFloat to null,            +myA.MyFloat().SetNull()+,                               +myA.MyFloat.SetNull()+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "extra level" to get to the actual values, i.e. the +GetVal()+ bit in C\+\+ and +Val+ bit in C# is needed due to the fact that the member are contained, together with the change and null flags, in a _container_. That there are two different ways of doing the operations in C\+\+ is because of a clever C\+\+ construction, _proxy objects_. More on containers and proxies later.

C# has only one way of doing the operations, and the C# interface uses properties for accessing the values - not as in Dob properties, but as in the language construct. (Look it up in your favourite C# reference if you don't know what they are.)

Things get a bit more interesting when accessing nested members, see <<nested_syntax>>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Casting objects up and down in the inheritance hierarchy also differs between the languages, see <<type_casting>> for more information.

==== Containers and Container Proxies
As mentioned in other parts of this document each member in a class has two flags associated with it; the _IsNull_ flag and the _IsChanged_ flag. To associate these flags with the value all three (the value and the two flags) are all put inside a _container_. The container has functions for getting and setting the value (which check/update the flags) and for changing the flags.

There are containers for all of the types in the Dob, e.g. Int32Container, Float64Container EntityIdContainer, and so on. There are also containers for user-generated types (classes and enums), and they are defined in the auto-generated code, so in the above example there would be a definition of AContainer and BContainer.

The members of the class A would be of type BContainer and Float32Container, and B's would be of type Int64Container.

The containers introduce an extra level of indirection, which shows itself in the "GetVal()", "SetVal()" and "Val" parts of the expressions above. This unfortunately has the effect of cluttering up the code a bit, so to reduce this cluttering (in C\+\+, which is the only supported language where it is possible) _container proxies_ were introduced. They are really just an intermediate object that allows safe use of operator overloading, and they are what allows "myA.MyB()\->MyInt().SetVal(3)" to be replaced with "myA.MyB()\->MyInt() = 3" (as shown in the tables above). The proxies are meant to be transparent, but they do not have all operations overloaded, so for example if you're manipulating a string, you will probably have to do GetVal() to be able to get to most of the string operations.

Note that these proxies (Container Proxies) should not be confused with the proxies that the Dob passes to the applications in the distribution callbacks. The Container Proxies are only meant to simplify use of the typesystems containers, whereas the proxies in the distribution callbacks are used to encapsulate a collection of data and metadata into a single object for the callback (basically allowing the callback to take just a few arguments, instead of a whole bunch, where most applications only use a few).

===== Smart pointers - boost::shared_ptr
To guarantee that all dynamically allocated memory is deallocated the Dob uses the +boost::shared_ptr+ implementation of smart pointers. You can find more information on how to use them here: http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm.

The reason for using shared_ptr for all Dob objects is that we need to have pointers to objects for polymorphism to work properly, and since C\+\+ is not garbage collected we do not want to use raw pointers. +shared_ptr+ is a smart pointer that automatically deletes the object pointed to when there are no references to it.

Here is part of the introduction from that page:

*********************************************
Smart pointers are objects which store pointers to dynamically allocated (heap) objects. They behave much like built-in C\+\+ pointers except that they automatically delete the object pointed to at the appropriate time. Smart pointers are particularly useful in the face of exceptions as they ensure proper destruction of dynamically allocated objects. They can also be used to keep track of dynamically allocated objects shared by multiple owners.

Conceptually, smart pointers are seen as owning the object pointed to, and thus responsible for deletion of the object when it is no longer needed.
*********************************************

The boost::shared_ptr type is going to be included in the next C\+\+ standard (TR1).

In C# there is no need for a smart pointer, since it has a garbage collector.

See <<type_casting>> for more information on how to cast smart pointers.

===== Hints for Debugging
It is possible to look at the contents of a Dob object in the debugger. Since the containers are all part of a class hierarchy the objects may seem a little difficult to understand at first. But just remember these things:

- Value containers have three values: m_Value, m_bIsNull and m_bIsChanged (which is the member value and the null and change flag respectively).
- Object containers have two values: m_pObject (which can be null) and m_bIsChanged.
- Smart pointers have two pointers in them, the reference count (pn) and the pointer to the object they point to (px). It is px that you are interested in.

The last point of course only applies to C\+\+ since C# does not have smart pointers.

The naming of the container members is also slightly different in C#.

[[type_casting]]
==== Type casting
Since the Dob types use inheritance any application that uses the Dob will have to do a lot of type casting. It is very important to understand how this is done, otherwise your application is likely to behave in very strange and unexpected ways.

For the discussion in this section the object hierarchy in <<example_object_hierarchy>> is used.

[[example_object_hierarchy]]
.Example object hierarchy
image::images/object_hierarchy.jpg["Example object hierarchy", width=350, link="images/object_hierarchy.jpg"]

===== C\+\+
The Dob C\+\+ interface uses +boost::shared_ptr+ (as described above) for passing around objects over the interfaces. For example this means that you get a +shared_ptr<Safir.Dob.Entity>+ (typedefed to +Safir.Dob.EntityPtr+ in the generated code) out of the +EntityProxy+ in +OnNewEntity+. If you're subscribing to +EntityParent+ you would want to somehow cast this +EntityPtr+ to an +EntityParentPtr+.

If it was an ordinary pointer you would either use a +static_cast+ or a +dynamic_cast+ operation (if you're unfamiliar with them you should look them up in your C\+\+ reference now), but since these are shared_ptrs you have to use +boost::static_pointer_cast+ or +boost::dynamic_pointer_cast+ to accomplish the same thing.

*boost::static_pointer_cast*

Use boost::static_pointer_cast when you know that the cast will succeed (i.e. you know what type the pointer really has). For example if you have an EntitySubscriber that has subscribed to EntityParent _only_ you can do:

.Using boost::static_pointer_cast
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void MyEntitySubscriber::OnUpdatedEntity
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy)
{
    EntityParentPtr parent =
        boost::static_pointer_cast<EntityParent>(entityProxy.GetEntity());
    ... Your code for handling the entity ...
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Note that this code will be used to handle updates to both of the subclasses of EntityParent too, but the assumption here is that you want to handle EntityParent and all its subclasses in the same way.)

*Warning:* If you add a subscription to AnotherEntity this code will cast AnotherEntity-objects to EntityParentPtrs too, which will result in undefined behaviour.

*boost::dynamic_pointer_cast*

Use boost::dynamic_pointer_cast when the pointer could be of several different types that you want to treat differently. For example if you have an EntitySubscriber that has subscribed to EntityChild _and_ AnotherEntity you can do:

.Using boost::dynamic_pointer_cast
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void MyEntitySubscriber::OnUpdatedEntity
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy)
{
    EntityPtr entity = entityProxy.GetEntity();

    EntityChildPtr child =
        boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<EntityChild>(entity);
    if (child != NULL)
    {
        HandleChild(child);
        return;
    }

    AnotherEntityPtr another =
        boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<AnotherEntity>(entity);
    if (another != NULL)
    {
        HandleAnother(another);
        return;
    }
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This would use a different routine to handle the different entities. Another example would be if you have subscribed to EntityParent _only_ but want to treat EntityChild2 differently:

.Another boost::dynamic_pointer_cast example
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void MyEntitySubscriber::OnUpdatedEntity
        (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy)
{
    EntityPtr entity = entityProxy.GetEntity();

    EntityChild2Ptr child2 =
        boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<EntityChild2>(entity);
    if (child2 != NULL)
    {
        HandleChild2(child2);
        return;
    }
    HandleParent(boost::static_pointer_cast<EntityParent>(entity));
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this code HandleChild2 gets called for all objects of the EntityChild2 type (remember that it can be a subclass of EntityChild2 too) and all others will be handled by HandleParent.

*Remember:* Dynamic casts are a lot more expensive than static casts. So use +static_cast+ when you can!

*Note:* You may have noticed that in both the above examples we extract the entity out of the proxy separately (and not inline in the casts). This is because the call to GetEntity in the callback proxy includes a deserialization of a binary blob into a "real class" (as explained briefly in the history section above). This is a non-trivial operation, so don't call it several times if you don't need to.

*Direct TypeId comparison*

You should *only* use direct TypeId comparison when you want to check that a type is of _one specific type but not a subtype._ For example if you have subscribed to EntityParent and you want to handle EntityParent differently from the subclasses you can do:

.Direct TypeId comparison
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void MyEntitySubscriber::OnUpdatedEntity
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy)
{
    EntityPtr entity = entityProxy.GetEntity();

    if (entity->GetTypeId() == EntityParent::ClassTypeId)
    {
        HandleParent(entity);
        return;
    }

    HandleChildren(boost::static_pointer_cast<EntityParent>(entity));
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here the HandleParent routine would be called for EntityParent objects _only_ and all other objects would be handled by HandleChildren.

This construction should be used _very_ sparingly. It is probably not the behaviour you are looking for, since it makes your application unable to handle derived objects in the way usually expected in object oriented systems.

*IsOfType*
The Dob provides an operation Safir::Dob::Typesystem::Operations::IsOfType that can be used to check the relationship between TypeIds while taking inheritance into account.

.IsOfType logic
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IsOfType(EntityParent::ClassTypeId,
         EntityParent::ClassTypeId)  //True
IsOfType(EntityParent::ClassTypeId,
         AnotherEntity::ClassTypeId) //False
IsOfType(EntityChild::ClassTypeId,
         EntityParent::ClassTypeId)  //True
IsOfType(EntityParent::ClassTypeId,
         EntityChild::ClassTypeId)   //False
IsOfType(EntityChild2::ClassTypeId,
         EntityChild::ClassTypeId)   //False
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This operation should _only_ be used when you need to check relationships between TypeIds. If you have an object you should be using +boost::dynamic_pointer_cast+.

===== C#
Since C# is garbage collected the Dob can use normal C# pointers to objects. This means that the normal type casting operations can be used. C# also does not have an equivalent to static_cast, so there is really only the choice between different forms of the dynamic_cast-like operation to choose between. If you're unsure of how C# casting works you should look it up in your C# reference, since a complete explanation is outside the scope of this document. But here are some pointers:

If you know the type of the object (by only having subscribed to one type), go right ahead and cast it:

.Type casting in C#
[cs]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    AnotherEntity ent = (AnotherEntity)entity;
   ... do something ...
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If for some reason the entity was not of the expected type an exception will be thrown, but remember that in this case that can be only due to a programmer error.

If you need to find out the type there are two ways to do it. One good and one not so good. Either you can use the _is_ operation to check that the type is of the right kind and then cast it using c-style casts to get an object of the right type:

.Using the +is+ operator
[cs]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
if (entity is EntityChild) //not recommended way of checking type
{
    EntityChild child = (EntityChild)entity;
    ... do something ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The drawback of using this approach is that you in fact get two type checks, one in the is operation and one in the cast operation. C# provides another operation that means that you only get one type check:

.Using the +as+ operator
[cs]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
EntityChild child = entity as EntityChild;
if (child != null)
{
    ... do something ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prefer using the _as_ operation in C#.



=== Other details
Details, details, details and even more details...

[[change_flags]]
==== Change flags
As mentioned before (<<member_flags>>) each member inside a Dob object (i.e. Entity, Message, Service, and Item, but not Struct, see <<items_and_structs>>) has two flags associated with it, an IsNull flag and an IsChanged flag (often called a _null flag_ and a _change flag_, respectively).

The distribution mechanism uses the change flags to provide meaningful change information in the different distribution mechanisms, which you can read more about in <<interpreting_change_flags>>. This section covers only how the change flags work inside an object inside one single process.

When an object is created all change flags are set to false. When a method to change a members value is called the change flag for that member is set to true (even if the value was the same as before, i.e. it didn't change!). If the value is changed to null (via SetNull()) it is also set to true.

If a member inside an item inside an object is changed only the change flag on the nested member is set.

The change flags' values can be checked using the IsChanged()-methods on the members. In the case of a simple member (i.e. not an item) the flag's value is received, but in the case of an item true is returned if _any one of the item's members are changed_. So IsChanged on an item member is recursive! If you need to find out if a change flag is set on the member itself, rather than on one of its members you can use IsChangedHere().

An example to make this clearer:

[[my_object]]
.Type definition for MyObject type.
`-----------------`----------
Member Name       Type
-----------------------------
A                 Int64
B                 String
C                 MyItem
-----------------------------


[[my_item]]
.Type definition for MyItem type.

Member Name       Type
-----------------------------
X                 Int32

--------------------------

We have two types, MyObject and MyItem (<<my_object>> and <<my_item>>), where MyObject contains among other things an item of type MyItem.

If we have an object with change flags set like in <<object_with_changeflags>> (note that member C has a change flag of its own as well as a change flag for each member in it) the result of the calls to IsChanged would be like in <<ischanged_results>>.

C           true         false
C::X        true         N/A
C::Y        false        N/A
--------------------------------------------




There are also methods to explicitly set the change flags, SetChanged(bool) and SetChangedHere(bool). As in the case of IsChanged the SetChanged-method on items is recursive, so if you need to change only the flag on the item itself you will have to use SetChangedHere. (In fact the above example could only be produced from a newly created object using some SetChanged methods).

So, what of all this stuff do you need to use? Probably only the IsChanged() method. All the other stuff is mostly used behind the scenes by the Dob to weave its magic. But there may be times that you have to do something like this.



==== The reflection interface^adv^
The reflection interface can be used to interrogate (and modify) anonymous Objects about their member names, types and values. This is something that not many applications should have to do, and therefore it is not described fully in this document.

But here are some hints:

- The Safir.Dob.Typesystem namespace contains a lot of functions for asking the typesystem about static information about types (e.g. what is the name and type of the third member of this type?).
- Safir.Dob.Typesystem has an ObjectFactory that allows applications to create an object straight from a TypeId.
- All Dob objects have GetMember(...) routines that return a ContainerBase for a specified member and array index. This can be casted to a container of the correct type, and thereafter manipulated.
- Very few of the routines in the reflection interface check for errors. If you call them with incorrect arguments the results are usually undefined. E.g. If you try to get the type of the 4th member of a type that has only 3 members you will probably get an undefined value as the type.

_Use with care!_ or even better: ``With great power comes great responsibility!''

== The distribution mechanisms

This chapter will give more details of how to use the distribution mechanisms of the Dob.

=== Consumers and Callbacks
Before learning about how to connect to the Dob we need to define a few basic concepts.

The first basic concept is a +Consumer+. A consumer is an interface, or an abstract base class, which represents a _role_ or a set of functionality that an application can have. For example, the +MessageSubscriber+ consumer is an interface that an application has to implement in order to be able to receive messages through a subscription.

The second basic concept is are +Callbacks+. Each consumer has one or more callbacks, which are abstract methods that application has to implement. The MessageSubscriber consumer interface has one callback +OnMessage+, which is called by the Dob each time a message is received.

The third concept is +Dispatching+, which is the name of the strategy that the Dob uses to be able to call the callbacks. We will get to dispatching in a moment (<<dispatching>>), but for the moment all you need to know is that Dispatching is what causes the callbacks to be called.

=== Connections
For an application to talk to the Dob it needs a connection. There are in fact two kinds of connections; one that is called Connection and one that is called SecondaryConnection. In this document "connection" will be used when either kind of connection is implied, "primary connection" when Connection is referred to and "secondary connection" when a SecondaryConnection is referred to.

First we'll describe primary connections, and we'll cover secondary connections later in this chapter (<<secondary_connections>>).

To create a primary connection the application must create a Connection object and then call +Open+ on it. The +Open+ method takes a number of parameters:

- A connection name and a connection instance. These are used to uniquely identify the connection in the system. No two connections can have the same name and instance.
- A context, which is something that the Dob will (it is not implemented yet) use for Replay. Currently all applications should connect with context 0.
- A +StopHandler+ consumer, which the Dob uses to tell the application to stop executing. Stop orders are described in <<stop_orders>>.
- A +Dispatcher+ consumer, which the Dob uses to tell the application that there is data available to it, which it will receive if it calls the +Dispatch+ method. Dispatching is discussed in the next section.

When an application wants to close a connection it calls Close. It is not necessary to call Close before application shutdown, since the Connection destructor will do that automatically.

[[dispatching]]
==== Dispatching

When a connection is opened a separate thread is started in the application. This thread, known as the _dispatch thread_ listens to a shared memory event which signals that something has happened that the application needs to know about, e.g. a message that the application is subscribing to has arrived. When this event is triggered, the dispatch thread calls the +OnDoDispatch+ callback of the +Dispatcher+ consumer.

When this happens the application *must* notify (through an event or some other mechanism) the thread that the connection was started in that it should call +Dispatch+ on the connection. When the Dispatch method is called the Dob will call all ``pending'' callbacks, e.g. +OnMessage+ for received messages.

The reason for all this is to make things easier for the application developer as well as removing the need for the Dob connection to be thread safe (which would inevitably make it less efficient and slower).

The upshot is that all callbacks (except, of course, the +OnDoDispatch+ one) are called _from the same thread that opened the connection_, which means that most applications should not have to worry at all about locking and having multiple threads.

*Important:* Do the thread switch as described above, or things will probably crash in surprising ways.

<<dispatching_sequence_diagram>> shows the dispatching sequence.

[[dispatching_sequence_diagram]]
.Dispatching sequence diagram
image::images/dispatching_sequence_diagram.jpg["Dispatching Sequence Diagram", width=450, link="images/dispatching_sequence_diagram.jpg"]

If you're using C\+\+ and ACE the SDK provides a Dispatcher class that does the thread switch and calls Dispatch, see <<ace_dispatcher>>.

[[secondary_connections]]
==== Secondary Connections
Whereas a primary connection is a real connection to the Dob, a secondary connection is only a "handle" to a primary connection.

Each application needs one primary connection (at least, see <<multithreading>>). This connection is the one that the Dob knows about and through which data is dispatched. A secondary connection is used by other parts of the application to "attach" to the primary connection.

The reason for providing this functionality is so that different modules of an application can use the same connection without passing around the primary connection object, something that is not even possible if the parts are written in different languages (like a C# plugin to a C\+\+ application). Instead the modules attach to the main program's connection using a secondary connection.

When creating a secondary connection you can either specify a connection name and instance to get a specific connection instance, or not specify anything at all, in which case you will be given the first connection that was created in the current thread.



=== Using the mechanisms
The three different distribution mechanisms of the Dob are used in different ways and require different things from the user application.

But before attacking the mechanisms themselves we need to talk about a addressing and something called proxies.

[[addressing]]
==== Addressing
The Dob uses logical addressing for its distribution mechanisms, which means that you use a logical name for which applications to send messages to, for example.

There are two concepts that we'll introduce here (they're described in greater detail later), _channels_ and _handlers_.

A _channel_ is like an FM radio frequency; when you send, you're sending on a particular frequency, and when you're receiving, you're listening to a particular frequency. When you send messages, you send them on a channel, and when you subscribe to messages, you subscribe to a particular channel (or all channels, which is where the analogy isn't quite as good any more).

A _handler_ is the concept that is used for addressing requests (both service and entity requests). A handler is more like a telephone number where only one person can have a particular telephone number (and has to register with the phone company to have it), but anyone can phone that person, as long as they know the number. To be able to receive service and entity requests an application has to register as a handler for that entity or service with the Dob. Then any application can send requests to it, as long as it knows the handler id (the "telephone number" to the handler).

Also, to be allowed to _own entity instances_ an application has to register an entity handler for that entity type. Entity instances are the _only_ thing that it is possible to _own_, and this document tries to only use "own" in that sense. Handlers are registered, not owned, entities are not owned (as opposed to entity instances), but there can be entity handlers registered, and so on.

[[proxies]]
==== Proxies
There are quite a few different callbacks for different kinds of data, and most of them take some kind of _proxy_ as an argument. The proxies are really only a container for a whole bunch of arguments that the user might need inside the callback, but instead of passing all the arguments separately they are collected into one proxy. This simplifies things for the application, which need only care about the parts of the proxy that it needs, and it makes it easier to add more information in a callback in the future, should there be a need to, without breaking the interfaces.

Not all methods on the proxies are applicable in all situations, for example you cannot call +GetPrevious+ on an +EntityProxy+ obtained in an +OnNewEntity+, since there is no previous version of an entity that was just created, but in +OnUpdatedEntity+ or +OnDeletedEntity+ calling +GetPrevious+ will give you the version of the entity that you got in the previous subscription response for that instance.

Internally the proxies contain direct references into the Dob shared memory, which means that there are some constraints on how you can/should use them. Mainly, _you're not allowed to copy a proxy_, and _you're not allowed to keep a proxy_! The rationale for the second is that keeping it would also keep the data in the shared memory, which could cause the Dob to run out of shared memory, and the rationale for the first constraint is to make it more difficult to keep the proxy.

Proxies are (with a couple of exceptions) received as parameters to callbacks. After returning from the callback the shared memory that the proxy refers to is released, and the proxy therefore becomes invalid. If you try to use a proxy obtained through a callback after returning from that callback an exception will be thrown!

Of course it is possible to pass proxies to other methods, as long as the proxy is not copied. Passing it as a const-reference (+const EntityProxy& proxy+) works very well in C\+\+.

==== Messages
<<messages_sequence_diagram>> shows a sequence diagram of how Dob Messages are handled.

[[messages_sequence_diagram]]
.Sequence diagram for messages
image::images/messages_sequence_diagram.jpg["Messages Sequence Diagram", width=350, link="images/messages_sequence_diagram.jpg"]

For messages there are two different roles involved. The Message Sender sends messages and the Message Subscriber receives messages. The subscriber needs to set up the subscription, and subsequently it will receive messages in its +OnMessage+ callback function whenever a Message Sender sends a message.

===== Channels
For every message type there can be several message channels. A subscriber can subscribe to all channels, or to only a specific channel. A sender has to send on a specific channel.

Channels are identified by the class _Safir.Dob.Typesystem.ChannelId_, which is a hashed type as described in <<hashed_types>>.

Most of the time only one channel is needed, and then the default channel should be used. The default constructor for ChannelId creates a default channel ChannelId. 

The constant ChannelId::ALL_CHANNELS is used to identify _all channels_, and can be used to subscribe to all channels for a certain message type.

It is worth noting that the channel is all the addressing there is for messages, i.e. it is completely transparent to the sender and receiver whether they reside on the same or different computers in the system.

===== Subscribing to messages
Two steps are necessary to receive messages. The first is to implement the Safir.Dob.MessageSubscriber interface:

.Message subscriber class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleMessageSubscriber : public Safir::Dob::MessageSubscriber
{
public:
    virtual void OnMessage(const Safir::Dob::MessageProxy messageProxy);
};
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The second step is to start the subscription by calling the +SubscribeMessage+ method on the Dob connection object. This method takes a TypeId (the message type to subscribe to), a ChannelId (the channel to listen to) and a pointer to a class that implements the MessageSubscriber interface.

.Subscribing to a message
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.SubscribeMessage
        (Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleMsg::ClassTypeId,
         Safir::Dob::Typesystem::ChannelId::ALL_CHANNELS,
         this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This subscribes to VehicleMsg (and all messages that inherit from VehicleMsg) on all channels, and the +OnMessage+ callback will be called by the Dob for each received VehicleMsg.

If you do not want to include subclasses in your subscription, there is an overload to the +SubscribeMessage+ method that allows you to specify whether or not to include subclasses. Default behaviour of most applications should be to include subclasses.

.Handling OnMessage callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleMessageSubscriber::OnMessage
                    (const Safir::Dob::MessageProxy messageProxy)
{
    Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleMsgPtr vehicle =
        boost::static_pointer_cast
        <Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleMsg>(messageProxy.GetMessage());

    ... do something with vehicle ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See <<type_casting>> for more information on the casting in the example above.

To cancel a subscription you call the +UnsubscribeMessage+ method on the Dob connection object. (It is not necessary to do this before closing a connection or before the application shuts down, the Dob will handle that automatically when the connection is destroyed/closed.)

.Removing a message subscription (unsubscribing)
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.UnsubscribeMessage
    (Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleMsg::ClassTypeId,
     Safir::Dob::Typesystem::ChannelId::ALL_CHANNELS,
     this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A note on combinations of subscribe and unsubscribe: If you subscribe to ALL_CHANNELS, but unsubscribe the default channel you will receive all VehicleMsg:es except those sent on the default channel. You can also do things like subscribe to VehicleMsg including subclasses, and then do an unsubscribe to VehicleMsg not including subclasses, which would make you only receive subclasses to VehicleMsg, but not VehicleMsg itself. These rules apply _per consumer_, so subscriptions set up with one consumer are not affected by unsubscribes made with another consumer.

===== Sending messages
To send messages it is necessary to implement the Dob interface _MessageSender._ The MessageSender interface is used to manage overflow situations when sending messages.

.Message sender class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleMessageSender : public Safir::Dob::MessageSender
{
public:
    // Overrides MessageSender
    virtual void OnNotMessageOverflow();
};
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Messages are sent with the +Send+ function in the Safir.Dob.Connection class. This function takes the message as a parameter and a pointer to the MessageSender interface.

When an overflow occurs the +Send+ function will throw an exception (Safir.Dob.OverflowException). This means that the applications message out queue is full, and that the application should not try to send any more messages until told otherwise (and the message that was passed to the Send function was not sent). When the message out queue is no longer full the Dob will call the +OnNotMessageOverflow+ method in the MessageSender passed in the send call that failed, which means that it is now okay to start sending messages again.

.Sending a message
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleMsgPtr msg =
                            Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleMsg::Create();
msg->MessageText() = L"Something happened to a vehicle!!!";
try
{
    m_connection.Send(msg, Safir::Dob::Typesystem::ChannelId(), this);
}
catch (const Safir::Dob::OverflowException &)
{
    // Doh! I got an exception so I have to remember the message and
    // send it again after I have received an OnNotMessageOverflow
    // callback
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

==== Services
<<services_sequence_diagram>> contains a sequence diagram for how services are handled.


[[services_sequence_diagram]]
.Sequence diagram for services
image::images/services_sequence_diagram.jpg["Services Sequence Diagram", width=350, link="images/services_sequence_diagram.jpg"]


For services there are two different roles involved. The ServiceHandler is the component implementing the service and the Requestor is the component using the service. The Handler needs to register the service and then the Requestor can send requests to it.

===== Handlers
For every service type there can be several service handlers. A service handler has to be registered with a specific handler id, and a requestor has to send service requests to a specific handler, identified by the handler id.

Handler ids are identified by the class +Safir.Dob.Typesystem.HandlerId+, which is a hashed type as described in <<hashed_types>>.

For most services there is only one handler, and then the default handler should be used. The default constructor for HandlerId creates a default handler identifier.

There is also a constant +HandlerId::ALL_HANDLERS+, which can be used for subscribing to registered handlers, as described <<handler_registration_subscription>>. It is considered an error to use +ALL_HANDLERS+ for either registration or sending requests.

The HandlerId is all the addressing that is needed. The request will be sent to the registered handler regardless of whether it is located on the same computer in the system or on a different one.

[[service_handler_registration]]
===== Registering a service handler
Two things need to be done to register a service handler. The first is to implement the Dob ServiceHandler interface. The ServiceHandler consumer interface allows the owner to receive service requests and be notified if some other application _overregisters_ the handler.

_Overregistration_ occurs when another application registers the same handler for the same service. This will cause the current handler to loose the registration, which is known as an overregistration.

.Service handler class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleServiceHandler : public Safir::Dob::ServiceHandler
{
public:

    //Overrides ServiceHandler
    virtual void OnServiceRequest
        (const Safir::Dob::ServiceRequestProxy serviceRequestProxy,
         Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr         responseSender);

    virtual void OnRevokedRegistration
        (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId     typeId,
         const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId& handlerId);
};
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The second thing that needs to be done is to call the RegisterServiceHandler method on the Dob connection object.

.Registering a service handler
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.RegisterServiceHandler
    (Safir::BearingDistanceService::ClassTypeId,
     Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId(),
     this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After this call is complete the service handler is registered, with the default handler id. If another application had previously registered the same handler for the same type it will now get a call to +OnRevokedRegistration+, to tell it that someone has _overregistered_ its handler.

The above registration mechanism is "hard" in the way that it overregisters previous registerers. There is an alternative, _pending registration_ which is described in <<pending_registrations>>.

It is possible to subscribe to handler registrations, so an application might at this point be told that the service handler is registered. See <<handler_registration_subscription>>.

The +OnServiceRequest+ callback will now be called whenever the application receives a service request.

Every service request must be responded to with an object that inherits from the Safir::Dob::Response class. The response is sent using the ResponseSender that is received in the +OnServiceRequest+ callback.

.Handling the OnServiceRequest callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleServiceHandler::OnServiceRequest
    (const Safir::Dob::ServiceRequestProxy serviceRequestProxy,
     Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr         responseSender)
{
    Capabilities::Vehicles::BearingDistanceServicePtr bearingService =
        boost::static_pointer_cast
            <Capabilities::Vehicles::BearingDistanceService>
            (serviceRequestProxy.GetRequest());

    ... validate request contents ...

    if (bearingService is a correct request)
    {
        ... do something ...

        responseSender->Send(Safir::Dob::SuccessResponse::Create());
    }
    else
    {
        // Send an error response
        Safir::Dob::ErrorResponsePtr response =
           Safir::Dob::ErrorResponse::CreateErrorResponse
               (Safir::Dob::ResponseGeneralErrorCodes::SafirReqErr,
                L"The request didn't contain all expected data");
        responseSender->Send(response);
    }
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to keep the +responseSender+ "for later" if it is not possible to send the response immediately (e.g. if the application has to wait for a database query to complete before sending the response). It is considered a programming error to not send a response to a request (and the ResponseSender destructor will try to alert you to that fact if you fail to use it).

To stop handling a service you call the UnregisterHandler method. (It is not necessary to do this before closing a connection or before the application shuts down, the Dob will handle that automatically when the connection is destroyed/closed.)

.Unregistering the handler
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.UnregisterHandler(Safir::BearingDistanceService::ClassTypeId,
                               Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId()));
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

===== Response types
There are two base classes for responses, +Safir.Dob.SuccessResponse+ and +Safir.Dob.ErrorResponse+ (they in turn inherit from +Safir.Dob.Response+, but no other responses should do that). If a custom response is needed (e.g. responding with the result of a database query, or with error information from a database query), create your own dou-file, inheriting from either of these two.

There is one more predefined error response, +Safir.Dob.ErrorListResponse+, which allows many errors to be specified, typically used to report errors for individual members in the request.

The parameter file +Safir.Dob.ResponseGeneralErrorCodes.dou+ contains some predefined error codes that can be used for the +Code+ field in error responses.

===== Sending service requests
To send a service request you have to have a class that implements the Requestor consumer interface and create a request and send it using the +ServiceRequest+ method in the Dob connection object.

.Request sender class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleServiceRequestSender : public Safir::Dob::Requestor
{
public:
    // Overrides Requestor
    virtual void OnResponse(const Safir::Dob::ResponseProxy responseProxy);

    virtual void OnNotRequestOverflow();
};
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The +OnResponse+ callback will be called with the response to your request, and the +OnNotRequestOverflow+ callback will be called when it is okay to start sending requests again after an overflow has occurred.

Sending a request is done like this:

.Sending a service request
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleServicePtr request =
    Capabilities::Vehicles::VehicleService::Create();

request->ServiceText() = L"Do something!";
try
{
    Safir::Dob::RequestId reqId = m_connection.ServiceRequest
        (request,
         Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId()
         this);
}
catch (const Safir::Dob::OverflowException &)
{
    //Doh! I got an exception! Better tell the operator to
    //press that button again in a little while.
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RequestId that is returned by the +ServiceRequest+ call is a unique identifier for that request. When the response is received the request id for the request that generated the response can be gotten from the ResponseProxy using the +GetRequestId()+ method. This is to allow applications to know which request generated which response.

If, for some reason, no response is sent from the service handler a time-out response is generated by the Dob to ensure that the sender of the request always receives a response.

If the handler is not registered the Dob will send an error response that indicates exactly that.

==== Entities
Entities are objects that are stored in shared memory and distributed between system nodes by the Dob. It is also possible to send requests on them, to create new entities, to update or delete them. These requests are very similar to service requests, although they are tailored to be used specifically on "things" rather than services. If you haven't read the previous section, on services, do so now, since this section assumes that you are familiar with how services and service handlers work.

<<entities_sequence_diagram>> shows a sequence diagram that describes (a shortened version of) the Entity Handling pattern describing how entities are handled in a Safir system.

When handling entities there are three roles involved. _Entity Handler_ is an application registered as a handler of the entity (and is allowed to _own_ entity instances), _Entity Subscriber_ is an application that subscribes to the entity and _Entity Requestor_ is an application sending a request to update the entity. At start-up Entity Subscriber sets up a subscription and Entity Handler registers an entity handler. When Entity Requestor sends a request the Dob sends it to Entity Handler. Entity Handler then validates the request, creates, updates or deletes the entity and sends a response to Entity Requestor containing the status of the request. The Entity Subscriber gets notified of the new entity.

[[entities_sequence_diagram]]
.Sequence diagram for entities
image::images/entities_sequence_diagram.jpg["Entities Sequence Diagram", width=350, link="images/entities_sequence_diagram.jpg"]


This section will first describe "simple" entity handling, such as is shown in <<entities_sequence_diagram>>, and later go on to describe more advanced concepts, such as _persistence_ and _injections_.

*First a note on application design:* You are not supposed to keep internal copies of entities in your program. It is often better to use Read (see <<reading_entities>>) when needed. If you often need to locate a particular entity instance depending on its contents you may want to maintain some kind of lookup-table in your program, to be able to find the correct instance quickly. This is better than iterating over all instances to find the correct one.

===== Handlers
For entities there are handlers, just as there are handlers for services. If you haven't already, please read the chapter on Services, and specifically the bit about service handlers.

An entity handler is registered to handle entity create, delete and update requests, and handlers are also allowed to own entity instances.

Use the default handler if there is only going to be one handler for a certain entity type.

When sending Create requests you need to specify which handler should create the instance. When sending an Update or Delete request the request will be automatically sent to the handler of the specified instance, so there is no need to explicitly specify the handler.

[[instanceid_and_entityid]]
===== InstanceId and EntityId
For every entity type there can be many entity instances. Each instance within an entity type is identified by a the class +Safir.Dob.Typesystem.InstanceId+, which is a hashed type as described <<hashed_types>>.

The class +Safir.Dob.Typesystem.EntityId+ is simply an entity TypeId coupled with an InstanceId, allowing it to be used to uniquely identify an entity instance (remember that there can be instances of different entity types with the same instance id).

There are several ways of generating an instance id:

1. Using a 64 bit integer
2. Using a string (InstanceId is a hashed type, so the string will give a unique 64 bit integer)
3. Randomly (InstanceId::GenerateRandom() will give a random instance id).

The instance id strategy should be chosen very carefully, to ensure that entity instances can be uniquely identified. An example: For Vehicles the instance id could be generated from the "Callsign" string member. This ensures that there can be no two vehicles with the same callsign, and that two applications processing information on the same vehicle (with the same callsign) will be referring to the same entity. Another example is the ProcessInfo entity that the Dob provides (shows processes that have a connection to the Dob) which uses the process PID as instance id.

Using random numbers is another good strategy for generating a unique instance id. Remember that the ids are 64bit integers, so the likelihood of collision when using random numbers is negligible (1 in 10^19^).

One other aspect of InstanceIds is who gets to decide which instance id to use, the Requestor or the Handler? For some entity types it might make sense to include an InstanceId in create requests, and for others it might make more sense not to include an InstanceId in the create request, but rather be told of which instance was created in the response. For this purpose all entity handlers are registered with a +Safir.Dob.InstanceIdPolicy+, which has two possible values +HandlerDecidesInstanceId+ and +RequestorDecidesInstanceId+.

*HandlerDecidesInstanceId*::
    As the name states, in this case the handler decides which instance id to use for creating new objects. As a response to the CreateRequest it should send a +Safir.Dob.EntityIdResponse+ to indicate success.
+
A Requestor to this handler *cannot* specify an instance id in its create request. If it tries to an exception will be thrown.

*RequestorDecidesInstanceId*::
    The requestor decides which instance it wants, and includes the instance id in the CreateRequest.
+
The handler *must* then create that instance, or if it cannot it should send an ErrorResponse. A handler that is registered with RequestorDecidesInstanceId is _not allowed to choose another instance than what is specified in the request_!
+
It is also not legal for the handler to send an EntityIdResponse in this case (exception will be raised).


[[registering_entity_handler]]
===== Registering an entity handler
Again there is a consumer interface to implement, +EntityHandler+, which allows the application to receive Create, Update and Delete requests. The interface also allows the applications to be told of overregistrations, just as for ServiceHandler registrations.

.Entity handler class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleHandler :
    public Safir::Dob::EntityHandler
{
public:
    // Overrides EntityHandler
    virtual void OnCreateRequest
         (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
          Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);

    virtual void OnUpdateRequest
         (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
          Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);

    virtual void OnDeleteRequest
         (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
          Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);

    virtual void OnRevokedRegistration
         (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId     typeId,
          const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId& handlerId);
};
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The +OnRevokedRegistration+ callback works exactly as for Services, as does the +responseSender+.

Applications register an entity handler by calling the +RegisterEntityHandler+ method in the Dob connection object. This method takes an EntityHandler (like the one declared above), a HandlerId, an InstanceIdPolicy and an entity TypeId.

.Registering an entity handler
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.RegisterEntityHandler
    (Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::ClassTypeId,
     Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId(),
     Safir::Dob::InstanceIdPolicy::HandlerDecidesInstanceId,
     this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the call to RegisterEntityHandler the application can immediately use the handler to set entity instances, and other applications can send entity requests to the EntityHandler.

To stop handling an entity you call the UnregisterHandler method. (It is not necessary to do this before closing a connection or before the application shuts down, the Dob will handle that automatically when the connection is destroyed/closed.)

.Unregistering an entity handler
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.UnregisterHandler(Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::ClassTypeId,
                               Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId()));
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

===== Handling Create Requests
The method OnCreateRequest is used by the Dob to notify the entity handler of a create request. The arguments to the method is an EntityRequestProxy which contains the request data and metadata, and a ResponseSender which must be used to send the mandatory response to the request.

.Handling a create request
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleHandler::OnCreateRequest
     (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
      Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);
{
    Capabilities::Vehicles::VehiclePtr vehicle =
        boost::static_pointer_cast<Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle>
            (entityRequestProxy.GetRequest());

    // Callsign and Vehicle ID is required for a create
    if (vehicle->Callsign().IsNull() ||
        vehicle->VehicleKey().IsNull())
    {
        //Set error
        Safir::Dob::ErrorResponsePtr response =
            Safir::Dob::ErrorResponse::CreateErrorResponse
            (Safir::Dob::ResponseGeneralErrorCodes::SafirMissingMember(),
             "Callsign and VehicleKey are mandatory elements");
        responseSender->Send(response);
        return;
    }

    //decide a good instance id (we registered as handler decides)
    const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::InstanceId instance(vehicle.VehicleKey())

    // Create vehicle
    m_connection.SetChanges(vehicle,
                            instance,
                            Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId());

    // Create response
    const Safir::Dob::EntityIdResponsePtr response =
        Safir::Dob::EntityIdResponse::CreateResponse
        (Safir::Dob::Typesystem::EntityId(vehicle.GetTypeId(),instance));
    responseSender->Send(response);
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note the use of the EntityIdResponse class for the response, which must be used as the success response when HandlerDecidesInstanceId is used as the InstanceIdPolicy for the handler. See <<instanceid_and_entityid>>.

===== Handling Update Requests
The method +OnUpdateRequest+ is used by the Dob to notify the entity handler of an update request on an entity owned by that handler. The arguments to the method is an EntityRequestProxy which contains the request data and metadata, and a ResponseSender which must be used to send the mandatory response to the request.

Note that the Dob guarantees that the update request is on an existing entity. There is no need to check for the existence of the entity inside +OnUpdateRequest+.

.Handling an update request
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleHandler::OnUpdateRequest
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
     Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);
{
    Capabilities::Vehicles::VehiclePtr vehicle =
        boost::static_pointer_cast
            <Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle>
            (entityRequestProxy.GetRequest());

    // Callsign
    if(vehicle->Callsign().IsChanged())
    {
        if(vehicle->Callsign().IsNull() ||
            Callsign has an illegal value)
        {
            //Set error
            Safir::Dob::ErrorResponsePtr response =
                Safir::Dob::ErrorResponse::CreateErrorResponse
                    (Safir::Dob::ResponseGeneralErrorCodes::SafirReqErr(),
                     "Illegal value for callsign");
            responseSender->Send(response);
            return;
        }
    }

    ... check all other members that are changed ...

    // Update vehicle
    m_connection.SetChanges(vehicle,
                            entityRequestProxy.GetInstanceId(),
                            Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId());

    // send a success response
    responseSender->Send(Safir::Dob::SuccessResponse::Create());
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note the use of +SetChanges+ instead of +SetAll+ above. +SetChanges+ will take the members that have its change flag set in the passed object and merge them into the existing entity that is stored in the Dob shared memory.

===== Handling Delete Requests
The method +OnDeleteRequest+ is used by the Dob to notify the entity handler of a delete request on an entity owned by that handler. The arguments to the method is an EntityRequestProxy which contains the request data and metadata, and a ResponseSender which must be used to send the mandatory response to the request.

Note that the Dob guarantees that the delete request is on an existing entity. There is no need to check for the existence of the entity inside +OnDeletedRequest+.

.Handling a delete request
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleHandler::OnDeleteRequest
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
     Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);
{
    m_connection.Delete(entityRequestProxy.GetEntityId(),
                        Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId());

    // send a response
    responseSender->Send(Safir::Dob::SuccessResponse::Create());
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that it is also possible to delete all entity instances owned by a handler by calling +DeleteAllInstances+ (but obviously this is not something that should be done as a result of a DeleteRequest, which is something that should operate on only one object).


===== Owning entity instances
Apart from handling requests on entities the entity handler is of course allowed to change an entity whenever it wants to. Generally this should be done using calls to +SetChanges+, rather than +SetAll+. The reason for this is the _injection timestamps_ as described in <<timestamp_merge>>

===== Subscribing to entities
Once more there is a consumer interface to be implemented to subscribe to entities, +EntitySubscriber+, which provides callbacks when an entity is created, updated or deleted.


.Entity subscriber class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleSubscriber : public Safir::Dob::EntitySubscriber
{
    // Override EntitySubscriber
    virtual void OnNewEntity
        (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy);

    virtual void OnUpdatedEntity
        (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy);

    virtual void OnDeletedEntity
        (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy,
         const bool                    deletedByOwner);
};
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The subscription is started by a call to the +SubscribeEntity+ method on the Dob connection object.

.Subscribing to an entity
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.SubscribeEntity
    (Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::ClassTypeId, this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The subscription will be to all instances of that entity, including subclasses. There are a couple of overloads to the +SubscribeEntity+ method that the subscriber can use if it wants to exclude subclasses, or just subscribe to a single entity instance.

After the call to +SubscribeEntity+ the Dob will start calling the +OnNewEntity+ callback for all entities that already existed when the subscription was set up, and thereafter it will call the callbacks whenever an entity is created, updated or deleted.

.Handling the +OnNewEntity+ callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleSubscriber::OnNewEntity
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy)
{
    Capabilities::Vehicles::VehiclePtr vehicle =
        boost::static_pointer_cast<Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle>
            (entityProxy.GetEntity());

    if (!vehicle->Callsign().IsNull())
    {
        ... Process Callsign here ...
    }
    else
    {
        ... do something else ...
    }

    ... process other fields ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See <<type_casting>> for more information on what +boost::static_pointer_cast+ is.

.Handling the +OnUpdatedEntity+ callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleSubscriber::OnUpdatedEntity
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy)
{
    Capabilities::Vehicles::VehiclePtr vehicle =
        boost::static_pointer_cast
            <Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle>
            (entityProxy.GetEntityWithChangeInfo());

    if (vehicle->Callsign().IsChanged() &&
        !vehicle->Callsign().IsNull())
    {
        const std::wstring callsign = vehicle->Callsign();
        ... process Callsign ...
    }

    ... process other fields ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note the use of +GetEntityWithChangeInfo()+ and the change flag on the callsign member to only look at it if it changes. See <<interpreting_change_flags>> for more information on how to interpret change flags. It is also possible to get hold of the _previous_ entity that was seen by a subscription. Use +entityProxy.GetPrevious()+ to get information about the previous subscription response.

.Handling the +OnDeletedEntity+ callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleSubscriber::OnDeletedEntity
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityProxy entityProxy,
     const bool                    deletedByOwner)
{
    ... do something ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If this class had been used to subscribe to several entities it can use +entityProxy.GetTypeId()+ to work out which way to handle the remove.

It is also possible to use +entityProxy.GetPrevious()+ to get hold of information about the entity that was deleted, such as actually looking at the entity like it was when it was previously dispatched to the subscriber.

The +deletedByOwner+ flag will be set to true if the owner deleted the entity with a call to +Delete+. It will be false if the owning handler was merely unregistered. This is to allow applications to work out whether the entity was removed due to it being explicitly deleted or because the application that owned the entity was stopped for some reason.

To stop subscribing to an entity the application calls the +Unsubscribe+ method in the Dob connection object. (It is not necessary to do this before closing a connection or before the application shuts down, the Dob will handle that automatically when the connection is destroyed/closed.)

.Removing an entity subscription (unsubscribing)
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.UnsubscribeEntity
    (Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::ClassTypeId,
     this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note:* You should read the section on <<interpreting_change_flags>> for more information about the change flags during entity subscriptions. The change flags are a very powerful tool to allow the subscriber to determine what has changed during an entity subscription.

[[reading_entities]]
===== Reading an entity
Sometimes the information in an entity is needed directly rather than as a part of a subscription (e.g. a Vehicle might contain an EntityId reference to another object, which can be _read_ when an update to the Vehicle occurs). For these occasions the Dob provides a method to synchronously read an entity, +Read+.

The +Read+ operation returns an EntityProxy, and as described above (<<proxies>>) there are some constraints on using proxies, but in this case it is not passed as a parameter into a callback, but as a return value from a method. Since it is illegal to "keep" an EntityProxy this means that a user of +Read+ has certain obligations:

Do not keep the proxy (it is possible, and it will appear to work, but remember that it will lock resources in the Dob).

If you're using C#, you _must_ dispose of the proxy before letting go of your reference to it. The proxy is an +IDisposable+ object, and C# best practice states that +IDisposable+ objects shall always be disposed explicitly. The easiest way to do this in an exception safe way is to use the +using+ construct:

.Using the +using+ construction with EntityProxy
[cs]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
using (Safir.Dob.EntityProxy ep = m_connection.Read(anEntityId))
{
    ... do something with the read entity ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advantage of using the above construct is that the +Dispose+ method of EntityProxy is guaranteed to be called regardless of whether an exception is thrown or a "return" is done inside the curly brackets.

If you forget to do this the garbage collector will try to dispose the proxy at some later time, at which time the Dob will detect that the proxy was not correctly disposed, and generate an error (as of this writing a dialog will pop up, and the program will terminate).

===== Iterating over entities
The Dob also provides a way of iterating over all instances of a certain entity type (including or excluding subclass instances). The way to do this differs slightly from language to language (the goal is to use the native iteration patters for each language).

Before looking at how this is done, a *word of warning*: Iterating over lots of instances can be quite time-consuming (e.g. imagine a system that can have 10000 vehicles, and every time an update occurs to one of them, a badly written application iterates over all of them), so in cases where an application wants to do it frequently it is preferable to maintain some kind of lookup table instead, using entity subscriptions. Or maybe using a better algorithm for choosing instance numbers, so that the iteration can be avoided.

Iterating over all Vehicles (including subclasses) in C\+\+:

.Iterating over entities in C\+\+
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
for (Safir::Dob::EntityIterator it = m_connection.GetEntityIterator
         (Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::ClassTypeId,true);
     it != Safir::Dob::EntityIterator(); ++it)
{
    ... do something with it ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dereferencing +it+ will give an entity proxy.

Note that the default constructor for EntityIterator creates an "end" iterator, pointing "one past" the last instance. This is a pattern that was inspired by the +boost::filesystem+ directory iterators.

Iterating over all Vehicles (including subclasses) in C#:

.Iterating over entities in C#
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
foreach (Safir.Dob.EntityProxy entityProxy in
         m_connection.GetEntityEnumerator
            (Capabilties.Vehicles.Vehicle.ClassTypeId,true))
{
    ... do something with entityProxy ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An aside: In this case it is not necessary to explicitly call +Dispose+ or somehow use +using+, since that is taken care of by the loop itself.

===== Sending entity requests
To be able to send requests on entities it is necessary to implement the +Requestor+ consumer interface, just like when sending service requests (so have a look at that section, because that example will not be repeated here...).

There are four methods in the Dob connection object that are used for sending requests on entities; two variants of +CreateRequest+, one +UpdateRequest+ and one +DeleteRequest+. All these methods take (among other things) a Requestor so that the Dob has somewhere to send the response.

All the request methods return a unique RequestId to allow the Requestor to know which response was generated by which request in the +OnResponse+ callback.

.Sending an update request.
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Capabilities::Vehicles::VehiclePtr request =
    Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::Create();

 ... set fields in request ...

Safir::Dob::RequestId reqId =
    m_connection.UpdateRequest(request, myVehicleInstance, this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the handler has processed the request it sends a response back telling the sender the status of the request. The Dob sends this response to the OnResponse callback in the Requestor interface. If the response was successful then the change of the entity is also sent if the requestor has a subscription. There is no predetermined order between the response and subscription messages and no assumptions should be made on what is received first.

If, for some reason, no response is sent from the owner then a time-out reply will be generated to ensure that the sender of the request always receives a response.

.Handling the OnResponse callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleSubscriber::OnResponse
    (const Safir::Dob::ResponseProxy responseProxy)
{
    if (responseProxy.IsSuccess())
    {
        .... handle success response, maybe ...
        return
    }

    ... handle the error ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


===== Some notes on the CreateRequest methods
There are two variants of the +CreateRequest+ method in the Dob connection class:

[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Safir::Dob::RequestId CreateRequest
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityPtr&               request,
     const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId&   handlerId,
     Safir::Dob::Requestor* const               requestor) const;

Safir::Dob::RequestId CreateRequest
    (const Safir::Dob::EntityPtr&              request,
     const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::InstanceId& instanceId,
     const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId&  handlerId,
     Safir::Dob::Requestor* const              requestor) const;
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second one is (obviously, since it contains an InstanceId parameter) only possible to use when the handler uses +RequestorDecidesInstanceId+, but contrary to what might be expected the first one can be used for *both* types of handlers. If the handler is +RequestorDecidesInstanceId+ an instance id will be randomly generated. This behaviour can be used when the requestor doesn't care what instance id gets generated.

[[persistence]]
==== Entity Persistence
The Dob has an area of functionality known as _injections_, that allows entities to be injected from an _external source_. A special case of this is _persistence_, i.e. making entities survive an application or system restart. Persistence injections are known as _synchronous_ injections, since they will always occur synchronously, at application startup (or rather, when registration occurs), whereas the other kind of injection can occur asynchronously throughout the lifetime of a system.

Note that it is possible (indeed, it is easy) to use the persistence injections without having to use the other kind of injections.

This functionality is configured using the properties Safir.Dob.InjectionProperty and Safir.Dob.InjectionOverrideProperty. The possible values are:

- +None+
- +SynchronousVolatile+
- +SynchronousPermanent+
- +Injectable+

+None+ is the default, where nothing is remembered since the previous registration. The other values deserve their own subsections (although +Injectable+ will not be described in this chapter, but in <<systems_of_systems>>).

===== SynchronousVolatile
+SynchronousVolatile+ persistence is useful to make entities survive when an application restarts, but when the whole system does not. For example if an application crashes and is restarted automatically, or, in a system with redundant nodes, a node is shut down and the applications restarted on another node.

When an entity handler is unregistered, without the entity instances being explicitly deleted, the instances owned by that handler are kept in shared memory (they stay in the system as _ghosts_). When an application later registers an _injection handler_ (see <<simple_persistence>>) with the same handler id, it will be handed all the ghosts of the previous handler (the ghosts will be _injected_), and will be given the choice of whether to revive them or not.

If the whole system (all nodes) is restarted at the same time the ghosts will be lost, hence the "volatile"-part of the name.

Note: The ghosts are distributed to all nodes, including restarting ones, so that the resurrection may take place in any node, "old" or new.

Note: If you explicitly delete instances before unregistering a handler there will be no ghosts. It is only instances that "die from other causes" that become ghosts...

===== SynchronousPermanent
+SynchronousPermanent+ persistence works exactly the same way as +SynchronousVolatile+ persistence, except that the ghosts are stored on disk, so that they survive whole system restarts. Hence the "permanent" part of the name.

In a system with +SynchronousPermanent+ persistence all entities marked as +SynchronousPermanent+ are stored to disk (files or a database) by the persistence service (provided by dope_main), and when a system restart occurs the first thing that is done is that Dope recreates all stored entities as ghosts in the system, so that when applications start they will be handed the ghosts to resurrect, just as in the +SynchronousVolatile+ case.

As you've probably understood +SynchronousPermanent+ persistence is really _just_ +SynchronousVolatile+ persistence _plus_ the permanent storage of ghosts.


[[waiting_for_persistence]]
===== Waiting for persistence data
When starting a system with persistence the Dob does not allow connections to be opened until the persistent instances have been distributed to all nodes. So when your application is allowed to start you are guaranteed to have persistent data available.

[[simple_persistence]]
===== Using persistence
If you just want entities to survive a system restart it is very easy to do. This section describes how to do this in the easiest possible way, but if you want more control and understanding over what is going on you probably want to read <<advanced_persistence>>.

Instead of inheriting from +Safir::Dob::EntityHandler+ you must inherit from +Safir::Dob::EntityHandlerInjection+. This will give you an additional four callbacks, which _you can leave empty_. If you're using C\+\+ you don't even have to create empty callback bodies, since the base class has empty default implementations.

You need to configure the Dob to persist your entity, and that is done by creating a dom-file for your class that specifies that permanent persistence is to be used:

.Permanent persistence dom file
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<propertyMapping xmlns="urn:safir-dots-unit"
                 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <property>Safir.Dob.InjectionProperty</property>
    <class>Capabilties.Vehicles.Vehicle</class>
    <memberMapping>
        <member>
            <propertyMember>Injection</propertyMember>
            <value>SynchronousPermanent</value>
        </member>
    </memberMapping>
</propertyMapping>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file must be named on the form <class name>-<property name>.dom, e.g. +Capabilties.Vehicles.Vehicle-Safir.Dob.InjectionProperty.dom+, and placed in the same directory as the dou file for Vehicle.

Assuming that your Dob is configured to support persistence (this is the default behaviour, see also <<persistence_config>>), your created entities should now survive system restarts.

When you have registered your handler, it will become the owner of the entities that were persisted.

If you want to understand what is going on, please read the next section, <<advanced_persistence>>.

[[advanced_persistence]]
===== Understanding persistence^adv^
To use persistence (of the volatile or permanent kind) there is a different consumer interface to implement, +Safir.Dob.EntityHandlerInjection+. This consumer has four additional callbacks, +OnInjectedNewEntity+, +OnInjectedUpdatedEntity+, +OnInjectedDeletedEntity+ and +OnInitialInjectionsDone+. The middle two of these are only used for asynchronous injections (i.e. the kind that uses deltas over a radio, as described above), so the only ones you might have to do anything in are +OnInjectedNewEntity+ and +OnInitialInjectionsDone+.

In C\+\+ all the four _Injection callbacks_ have an empty default implementation. This is not possible in C# since C# interfaces cannot have default implementations of any kind. This means that in C\+\+ you don't have to override these callbacks if you don't want to do anything inside of them. For this example we assume that there is something that we need to do in these callbacks (but since this is a C\+\+ example we only need to override the two callbacks that are actually used for persistent entities).

.Injection entity handler class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleHandler :
    public Safir::Dob::EntityHandlerInjection
{
public:
    virtual void OnCreateRequest
         (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
          Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);

    virtual void OnUpdateRequest
         (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
          Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);

    virtual void OnDeleteRequest
         (const Safir::Dob::EntityRequestProxy entityRequestProxy,
          Safir::Dob::ResponseSenderPtr        responseSender);

    virtual void OnRevokedRegistration
         (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId     typeId,
          const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId& handlerId);

    virtual void OnInjectedNewEntity
         (const Safir::Dob::InjectedEntityProxy injectedEntityProxy);

    virtual void OnInitialInjectionsDone
         (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId typeId,
          const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId& handlerId);
};
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first four overrides are of course the same as when registering an entity handler without persistence or injection support (see <<registering_entity_handler>>). I won't mention them again in this section, as they work exactly the same.

The handler is registered by calling +RegisterEntityHandlerInjection+, which has the same signature as +RegisterEntityHandler+ except that it takes an EntityHandlerInjection instead of an EntityHandler as its fourth argument.

.Registering an injection entity handler
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.RegisterEntityHandlerInjection
    (Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::ClassTypeId,
     Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId(),
     Safir::Dob::InstanceIdPolicy::HandlerDecidesInstanceId,
     this);
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When this call is complete the Dob will call +OnInjectedNewEntity+ for every entity instance that has been persisted using the specified +HandlerId+ (this last bit is important, _persisted objects remember the HandlerId it was created by, and can only be resurrected by the that HandlerId_). Doing nothing in the callback means that the _injection is accepted_, i.e. the application has approved the data and the entity can be created (before this it is not visible to other applications, it is a _ghost_). If the application wishes to reject the instance, it can call +Connection::Delete(...)+ which will cause the persisted entity not to become a "real" entity, and to be deleted from persistence storage.

Once all persisted instances have been accepted or rejected by the application the +OnInitialInjectionsDone+ will be called. This signals that all persistent objects for a certain handler have been injected. Again, you don't have to do anything in the callback.

(The ``you don't have to do anything'' bit is the reason why the strategy described in <<simple_persistence>> works so well.)

*Note:* In most cases it shouldn't be necessary to check the data coming in through persistence injections. After all, it is data that has already been checked by an earlier incarnation of your application! If it was good then it should be good now.

For our Vehicle example, let's assume that the vehicle handler application has to keep an internal instance lookup table (again, it shouldn't keep all the vehicle data internally, but it might be necessary to have lookup tables to quickly know which instance to +Read+, to get at the data). In this case we will want to add instances to the tables in +OnInjectedNewEntity+ and maybe update some status in +OnInitialInjectionsDone+.

.Handling the OnInjectedNewEntity callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleSubscriber::OnInjectedNewEntity
     (const Safir::Dob::InjectedEntityProxy injectedEntityProxy);
{
    Capabilities::Vehicles::VehiclePtr vehicle =
        boost::static_pointer_cast<Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle>
            (injectedEntityProxy.GetInjection());

    m_myLookupTable.Add(vehicle->Callsign(),
                        injectedEntityProxy.GetEntityId());

    ... do something else ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.Handling the OnInitialInjectionsDone callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleSubscriber::OnInitialInjectionsDone
     (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId typeId,
      const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId& handlerId);
{
    std::wcout
        << "Woohoo! I've got all my persisted entity instances"
        << std::endl;
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you need to create a dom file as described in <<simple_persistence>>, and then you are ready to go.


<<persistence_sequence_diagram>> shows this mechanism as a sequence diagram (note that the +Open+ call from +MyEntityHandlerInjection+ blocks until the PersistenceService has signalled that the persistence data is ready, as described in <<waiting_for_persistence>>).

[[handler_registration_subscription]]
==== Handler registration subscriptions
It is possible to subscribe to the registration of entity and service handlers through the +SubscribeRegistration+ method on the Dob connection object.
This is useful to be able to monitor the status of other applications in the system. E.g. is the application that handles this type of objects started and working?

The application needs a class that implements the +Safir::Dob::RegistrationSubscriber+ consumer interface.

.Registration subscriber class declaration
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class VehicleRegistrationSubscriber :
    public Safir::Dob::RegistrationSubscriber
{
    virtual void OnRegistered
        (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId      typeId,
         const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId&  handlerId);

    virtual void OnUnregistered
         (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId      typeId,
          const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId&  handlerId);
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then start the subscription (remember that you can do this on a service handler too!):

.Starting a registration subscription
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
m_connection.SubscribeRegistration
    (Capabilities::Vehicles::Vehicle::ClassTypeId,
     Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId::ALL_HANDLERS,
     true, //includeSubclasses
     true, //restartSubscription
     this) const;
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note the use of +ALL_HANDLERS+ above, that means that we're subscribing to the registration of all handlers for the specified type, rather than a specific handler, and since we've also specified +includeSubclasses+ we will also get a subscription response if a subclass of Vehicle gets registered.

When someone registers an entity handler or a service handler the Dob will notify the application of this through a call to the +OnRegistered+ method. (Note that the function has a TypeId and HandlerId as parameters and if the implementation of the interface is used for several different classes then these can be inspected to ascertain how to handle the information).

.Handling the OnRegistered callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleRegistrationSubscriber::OnRegistered
    (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId      typeId,
     const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId&  handlerId)
{
    ... do something useful ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a service or entity handler is unregistered the Dob will notify the application of this through a call to +OnUnregistered+. (A handler is unregistered when the owning application unregisters the handler or the application dies).

.Handling the OnUnregistered callback
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void VehicleRegistrationSubscriber::OnUnregistered
    (const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::TypeId      typeId,
     const Safir::Dob::Typesystem::HandlerId&  handlerId)
{
    ... do something useful ...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a registration goes down and up ``very quickly'', the subscriber is guaranteed to get first an OnUnregistered and then an OnRegistered callback. I.e. registration subscribers are guaranteed to be notified of the intermediate unregistrations, as opposed entity subscribers, who are not guaranteed to get told if an entity is deleted and then recreated immediately.

=== Aspects
Aspects are used to reduce the size of the Connection classes and header files, and to be able to classify peripheral or esoteric functionality as just that.

Currently there are three different aspects:

_ConnectionAspectMisc_::
        Contains miscellaneous functionality, such as GetConnectionName, SimulateOverflow etc.
_ConnectionAspectPostpone_::
        Contains functionality for postponing callbacks.
_ConnectionAspectInjector_::
        Contains functionality needed for injectors, for example the persistence service.

[[postpone]]
=== Postponing callbacks
Sometimes it is not possible to handle a certain callback "right away", either due to an overflow from the Dob, or due to some external circumstance. For just this situation the Dob provides functionality to delay, or _postpone_, a certain callback for a certain type until some criteria is fulfilled.

Calling +Postpone+ (can be found in the ConnectionAspectPostpone aspect) in a callback will cause the data that caused the callback to be kept (e.g. a message or request will be kept in the in-queue, or an entity subscription update will be held back) until either an overflow situation is resolved or the application calls +ResumePostponed+.

Note that postponed callbacks are always resumed when an overflowed queue is no longer full, so every time +OnNotMessageOverflow+ or +OnNotRequestOverflow+ is called an internal call to ResumePostponed is made.

A couple of examples are in place to make this clearer:

An application is required to send a request to some other application for every entity update (+OnUpdatedEntity+) that it receives through its entity subscription. If a lot of entities are updated "quickly" the application would soon get an overflow when sending the requests (remember that there is a limited maximum number of outstanding requests, the default is 10). The correct way of solving this (as opposed to an incorrect way, which would entail creating an infinite queue internally in the application) is to call Postpone when an overflow exception is caught. This will cause the Dob to not call OnUpdatedEntity again for any instance of the subscribed entity (and its subclasses) until the request out queue is no longer full. Once the request out queue is not full all the postponed entity updates will be received.

Another application is required to send some data to an external interface (e.g. a TCP link to some external computer/application) every time a request is received. If the external link overflows or goes down temporarily the application can no longer handle the requests, but it might be the wrong thing to just send an error response and letting the requestor handle the problem. Instead the application can call Postpone, and can then go on to handling other duties, until it detects that the external link is working again when it would call ResumePostponed, which causes the waiting requests to be dispatched (note of course that if it takes too long the request is likely to time out).

[[interpreting_change_flags]]
=== Interpreting change flags
The change flags described in <<change_flags>> are used by the Dob distribution mechanism to ensure that components can communicate meaning as well as content. This use is slightly different in the different mechanisms. But the aim is for the change flags to mean what you would expect them to mean.

==== Messages
Change flags are sent unchanged from a sender to all receivers. In a received message a change flag signifies something that the sender has changed, or wants the receiver to do. A member whose change flag is not set is something that the sender does not care about.

==== Entity subscriptions
Upon receiving an entity subscription callback the application can ask the Dob to provide change information for the entity (using +GetEntitWithChangeInfo()+ instead of +GetEntity()+). If +GetEntity+ is used all change flags will be set to false, but when +GetEntityWithChangeInfo+ is used the Dob will set the change flags to signal what has changed since the last subscription response.

So on the first subscription response (+OnNewEntity+) all change flags are set to true. On subsequent subscription responses for that instance (+OnUpdatedEntity+) only the members that have changed are marked as changed.

Note that this is guaranteed even if the subscriber misses an intermediate state, e.g. if the subscriber misses an entity update (if the owner updates faster than the subscriber can keep up with) all members _since the last update that the subscriber got_ will have their change flags set.

==== Requests on entities
Change flags are sent unchanged from a requestor to the entity handler. In a request a change flag signifies something that the requestor wants to change in the entity.

Any member that has a change flag set is a member that the requestor wants the entity handler to set in the entity.

If a change flag is set on a member that is null that means that the requestor wants that member to be set to null. If the change flag is not set on a null member it means that the requestor does not want that member to be changed.

==== Requests on services
Change flags are sent unchanged from a requestor to the service provider. In a service request a change flag signifies something that is a part of the service request. Any member that is not changed in the request is something that the requestor does not care about.

[[pending_registrations]]
=== Pending Registrations
A pending registration means ``I want to register this handler if there is no handler already. And if there is handler already registered, I want to become the registerer when that one disappears.''

This functionality is to be used for applications that implement hot-standby and/or redundancy. I.e. the application is started in several nodes and if the active instance fails, another should become active instead. See <<hot_standby>> for more information on how to implement hot-standby and redundancy.

To be able to do pending registration you need to implement the +ServiceHandlerPending+ or +EntityHandlerPending+ consumer interfaces. These add an additional callback +OnCompletedRegistration+ which is used to tell the application that it has become the registerer of a handler.

To perform the pending registration you call +RegisterEntityHandlerPending+ or +RegisterServiceHandlerPending+.

The +EntityHandlerPending+ consumer has all the Injection callbacks, since it is unlikely to want hot-standby without wanting at least +SynchronousVolatile+ persistence.

[[stop_orders]]
=== Stop orders
Stop orders are used in Safir systems to allow the system to tell applications to shut down gracefully. A stop order is delivered to the application through the +OnStopOrder+ callback on the +StopHandler+ consumer interface that is supplied when opening a Dob connection.

The Dob will call the +OnStopOrder+ callback when it has received a stop order for that application. These are sent by sending a +DeleteRequest+ on the relevant instance of the Safir.Dob.ProcessInfo entity. Open Sate (see <<sate>>) and subscribe to Safir.Dob.ProcessInfo, find the instance that describes your application and then send a +DeleteRequest+ on it, and your application will receive an +OnStopOrder+ callback.

Upon receiving a stop order the application shall shut down gracefully.

When an application has several connections to the Dob, only one of them should supply a StopHandler. It is the handler of this connections responsibility to tell the other parts of the application to shut down gracefully. If several connections have stop handlers there may be race conditions, since there is no guaranteed order between which stop handler gets called first.

== Configuration
There are many things in Safir SDK Core that can be configured. This chapter aims to describe the most important ones, but the adventurous can always delve into the parameters in the dou-files of Safir SDK Core.

=== Network config
A Safir SDK Core system can have two basic configurations, with respect to networking. _Standalone_ or _Multinode_. Standalone means that the system consists of only one node or computer. This is typically used for developer machines or systems that have only one node. Multinode is typically used when a system consists of several nodes, for example a couple of servers (where applications and databases run) and a few operator consoles (where only the HSI runs).

[[standalone_config]]
==== Standalone
To configure a system to be Standalone (which is the default configuration anyway) you need only change one parameter in Safir.Dob.DistributionChannelParameters.dou (and you can do that without recompilation, as described in <<parameters>>). Set the +MulticastAddress+ of the first DistributionChannel in the array (the one named _System_) to be "127.0.0.1" (i.e. localhost), and your system is now standalone, and _no data is sent over the network by the Dob_. 

.Standalone configuration
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<arrayElements>
  <arrayElement>
    <object>
      <name>Safir.Dob.DistributionChannel</name>
      <members>
        <member>
          <name>Name</name>
          <value>System</value>
        </member>
         ... IncludedNodes parameter that doesn't fit here ...
        <member>
          <name>MulticastAddress</name>
          <value>127.0.0.1</value>
        </member>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the MulticastAddress is set to 127.0.0.1 all the rest of the network configuration files are ignored.

You should also set up the parameters +Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.NumberOfNodes+ and +Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.Nodes+ to only contain the one node. This is not mandatory, but it may cause confusion to have several nodes defined in a one-node system.

==== Multinode
This section could have a lot of examples, but I think it would become unwieldy with huge amounts of xml files, so I'm keeping it brief and descriptive instead.

First of all you should specify the number of nodes that are part of your system. Do this using the two parameters +Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.NumberOfNodes+ and +Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.Nodes+. Then you have to decide which node is the persistence node, which you specify with the +Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.PersistentDbNode+ (if you're not using persistence, set it to -1 instead, as described in <<persistence_config>>).

Each node has to be configured to know which node number it is, which is done in the parameter +Safir.Dob.ThisNodeParameters.NodeNumber+. Change this to contain the node number of each node (yes, this means having different contents in that file on each node in the system, unless you use an environment variable in the parameter, as described in <<environment_parameters>>).

If your nodes have multiple network cards the Dob needs to be told which network card it should use, and this is done by specifying a network address in +Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.NetworkAddress+ (you only have to specify enough to uniquely identify the subnet that the card has, so if all your nodes are on the 192.168.123.\* network you only need to specify 192.168.123.0).

The last step to get a working multinode configuration is to change the Safir.Dob.DistributionChannelParameters dou file. What this file actually does is described below, but for now you just need to know that it specifies which multicast addresses the Dob uses. You need two +DistributionChannels+ defined, the +System+ and +PoolDistribution+ ones, which must be the first two distribution channels in the array.
Set the MulticastAddress members to be valid multicast addresses, that are not used for something else on your network (e.g. 224.10.10.127 and 224.10.10.128).

Now you should be able to fire up +dose_main+ on the nodes of your system and start communicating. The easiest way to tell if it is working is to have a look at what +dose_main+ prints to its stdout. If there is stuff there about "NodeUp" you're on the right track. Then start up Sate (see <<sate>>) and send and subscribe to some stuff across the network. 

[[local_objects]]
===== Local objects
One last thing before going into the deeper technicalities of network configuration: Objects that are not sent over the network, even in a multinode system.

For some entities, services and messages it is not desirable to have them sent over the network at all. These are known as _Local_ objects. Things like settings for an operator on one operator console or other things that only apply to the current node like which object is selected in the map are typically Local objects.

An object is specified as Local by mapping the +Safir.Dob.DistributionChannelProperty+ to it, with the value "Local" as DistributionChannel, using a dom file. 

.Specifying that an object is local.
[xml]

        </member>
    </memberMapping>
</propertyMapping>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

===== Distribution Channels
In a system with many nodes with different tasks it is not always necessary or desirable (e.g. for shared memory usage reasons) to send all data to all nodes. For example say there is one server that handles database stuff, and one that handles real-time tracking of all vessel in a harbour (using a radar or transponders or something like that). The applications on the database server have no need of the vessel data, and having them there would only use memory and generate CPU load (the Dob would still have to process them).

+DistributionChannels+ are the solution to this problem. They allow you to specify which data is sent to which nodes.

For the above example you could set up a distribution channel called VesselData, which only contains the nodes that need the vessel data (i.e. the tracking server and the operator consoles). You have to specify a new MulticastAddress for this distribution channel (this allows the filtering of the data to occur on the network card, generating no load on the CPU). 

For each type that is associated with the vessels (e.g. the vessel entities, and maybe some messages) you then specify that they use that distribution channel, using properties.

.A DistributionChannel for VesselEntity
[xml]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<propertyMapping xmlns="urn:safir-dots-unit"
                 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <property>Safir.Dob.DistributionChannelProperty</property>
    <class>Capabilties.Vessels.VesselEntity</class>
    <memberMapping>
        <member>
            <propertyMember>DistributionChannel</propertyMember>
            <value>VesselData</value>
        </member>
    </memberMapping>
</propertyMapping>
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no need to do any modifications to the applications involved.

It is possible to have up to 32 distribution channels defined for a system. But having more than 8 (or maybe 16 depending on your hardware) causes the filtering may move from the network card into the CPU. If you have other uses of multicast (IGMP) in your system one or more of these 8 hardware accelerated "slots" may already be occupied.

===== Priorities
In a system with many Dob objects competing for the network bandwidth it is possible to specify different priorities for the different objects.

The Dob supports up to six priority levels, which are defined in the +Safir.Dob.PriorityParameters+ parameter file.

It is also possible to specify whether a certain priority level uses _acks_ (acknowledgements) on the LAN. For most stuff acks are needed, since otherwise it is not certain that an entity update or a message is received on the network or not, but for cyclic data (stuff that is updated regularly, and where it doesn't matter that one update is missed every now and then) it is useful to avoid the extra network load generated by the acks.

An acked entity update, for example, will generate one packet for the entity update itself (sent by multicast to all nodes in the system), and then one ack packet from each of the receiving nodes. Disabling the acking will potentially reduce the collisions on the network quite drastically, allowing for higher throughput or lower LAN load (which might be wanted for other things).

===== Ports used
The Dob uses the following ports:
`-------------`--------------------------------------------------------
Port(s)       Use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
6970          KeepAlive messages, to know which nodes are running.
6971          Acknowledgements
6972-6977     Data (one port for every priority level)
31221         Low level error logs (from components that can't use Software Reports)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If the system is configured to be StandAlone (as described in <<standalone_config>>) only the 31221 port is used, the others are not opened or used.

[[persistence_config]]
=== Persistence config
The persistence service, provided by the +dope_main+ executable has a few different features that might be good to know about. It has two _backends_, one that persists entities to files, and one that persists them to a database. 

A few relevant parameters for the persistence service, apart from the ones described in <<simple_persistence>>.

_Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.PersistentDbNode_::
        Specifies which node should be the node that the persistence service is expected to run on. -1 means no persistence in the system at all (in this case dope_main should not be started.)
_Safir.Dob.PersistenceParameters.Backend_::
        Which backend should be used, Odbc database or files.
_Safir.Dob.PersistenceParameters.FileStoragePath_::
        The path where files are stored if the file backend is chosen. Obviously dope_main needs write permissions here.
_Safir.Dob.PersistenceParameters.OdbcStorageConnectString_::
        The connection string to use to connect to the database.

There is more information about the persistence service in <<persistence_service>>.

[[request_timeouts]]
=== Request timeouts config
Timeouts are defined using the properties Safir.Dob.RequestTimeoutProperty and Safir.Dob.RequestTimeoutOverrideProperty. If no response have been received when the timeout occurs, the Dob itself sends a timeout response to the Requestor. If the missing response arrives after this, it is just ignored. I.e., the Dob guarantees that the requestor will receive one, and only one, response.

The default timeout for service requests is 7 seconds and for entity requests 2 seconds, and these can be changed by changing the timeout properties on the +Safir.Dob.Entity+ and +Safir.Dob.Service+ classes.

Note that the RequestTimeoutProperty is inherited, whereas the RequestTimeoutOverrideProperty is not inherited, so setting a RequestTimeoutProperty on a class will cause all derived classes to get the same timeouts. The Override-property can be used when this is not the desired behaviour, or for making an exception on one level of an inheritance "tree".

[[queue_lengths]]
=== Queue lengths config
It is currently only possible to adjust the default queue lengths of the Dob. These parameters are located in Safir.Dob.QueueParameters.dou. There are parameters for setting the default queue length for the in and out queues of messages and requests.

This will soon^TM^ be improved by adding the possibility of changing the queue lengths for specific applications or connections.

The default queue lengths are 10 for all the queues.

WARNING: Before deciding to increase the default queue lengths you should have read and understood <<overflow_handling>>, and the two items on overflows in <<faq>>. It is important to understand what effects, other than just increasing memory use, this may have on your system.

[[memory_config]]
=== Shared Memory config
The Dob has two parameters that control the amount of shared memory used, +TypesystemSharedMemorySize+ and +SharedMemorySize+ (both can be found in Safir.Dob.NodeParameters.dou). The first parameter controls the amount of memory available for the typesystem (the internal tables for all types, and all parameters), and the second one controls the amount of memory available for the distribution mechanism.

The amount of memory that the typesystem needs is completely static, i.e. it does not change at all during runtime, so if you have been able to start +dose_main+ you know that you have enough memory allocated for the typesystem. 

Knowing what value to set +SharedMemorySize+ to is trickier, but one approach is to run the system and monitor the memory usage, for example using _dobexplorer_, which is described in <<dobexplorer>>.

[[software_reports]]
== Software Error Reporting
Software Reporting provides functionality for sending software reports from applications using the Dob as communication mechanism. Software Reporting introduces a number of Dob messages that correspond to the different types of software reports that can be sent.

To make the sending of a software report as simple as possible, Software Reporting provides interface libraries to be used by applications. The interfaces add common information, like timestamp, node name and sequence number, to the report.

Software Reporting provides a logger application (swre_logger) that subscribes for software reports and writes them to standard output or a log file. It is possible to set various filter conditions for the logger application. Type "+swre_logger -?+" to get a complete listing of the command line options.

=== Report types
There are five predefined report types with the following intended usage:

- *Fatal Error Report:* Use it to report static conditions that must be fulfilled to be able to start/continue executing the program, for example missing static resources or invalid configuration. After a fatal error has been reported the program should terminate.
- *Error Report:* Use it to report detected runtime errors, for example a message from an external system in an invalid format. Normally the program continues to execute, possibly in a degraded state.
- *Resource Report:* Use it to report a missing/acquired dynamic resource. Note that it is "ok" for dynamic resource to be temporary missing which means that a Resource Report should be sent only after a reasonably number of retries to acquire it.
- *Program Info Report:*  Use it to report internal program information for debugging purposes. Normally the sending of this report type is controlled by internal status variables that are set by sending program info commands to the program. This report type is used by the tracer functionality described in <<program_information>>.
- *Programming Error Report:* Use it to report programming errors, i.e. errors of assert-type. After reporting the application should terminate.

=== Send interface
To make the sending of a software report as simple as possible, Software Reporting provides interfaces (currently available for C\+\+, C#, Java and Ada) to be used by applications. The interface adds common information to the report before it is sent. The following information is added:

- Timestamp
- Sequence Numbers: A software report has two sequence numbers. The Connection Sequence Number is incremented for each software report sent from a particular Dob connection. The Type Sequence Number is related to the report type and each type (Fatal Error, Error etc) has its own numbering series. This makes it easy to detect missing reports even when a certain report type isn't logged.
- Connection name
- Node name

All +Send+ methods are thread safe.

=== Logger application
Software Reporting provides a separate logger application (swre_logger) that subscribes to software reports and writes them to standard output or file.

When logging to file, the max size of the log file is supervised by swre_logger. If the max size is reached the file is renamed to old_<original name> (an already existing "old" file is deleted) and a new log file is opened. This mechanism makes it possible to have logging to file without the risk of filling up the available disk space.

It is possible to set various filter conditions for swre_logger. Type "swre_logger -?" to get a complete listing of the command line options.

Swre_logger can be started in any number of instances in one or several nodes, each with its own filter conditions. For instance, it is possible to start an instance that logs only program information (PI) reports from a particular application.

[[program_information]]
== Software program information
Safir SDK Core provides support for applications to have a "back door" to make it possible to interactively enquire about the status of an application or to turn on and off debug logging. It also provides an interface that makes it easy to add debug trace logging to applications.

=== The backdoor command
Software Reporting defines a Dob message (Safir.Application.Backdoor) to be used to send program information commands to applications. Backdoor commands can either be sent using Sate (see <<sate>>), or by the command-line program "backdoor" (use "+backdoor -h+" to get info on usage).

There are some predefined backdoor commands that applications should handle:

- *Ping:* When receiving this command the application should send a Program Info Report as an indication that it is alive.
- *Help:* When receiving this command the application should send a Program Info Report that contains a listing of the supported backdoor commands.

Backdoor commands are defined as Dob messages and therefore sent to all subscribers. This means that applications have to check whether or not a backdoor message is addressed to the own application. Software Reporting provides classes (Safir.Application.BackdoorKeeper and Safir.Application.Backdoor) that simplifies the reception of backdoor commands. The classes provide this functionality:

- Setup of subscriptions for PI command messages.
- Checking of whether or not a PI command is to be handled by own application.
- Automatic answers to Ping commands.

Output from an application as a response to a backdoor command should be through Program Information Reports (see <<software_reports>>).

=== Tracer
////
Tracer text is located in a separate file, tracer.txt
////

include::tracer.txt[]

[[persistence_service]]
== The persistence service
The persistence service is provided by the executable dope_main, which performs the storing of the entities to files on disk or to a database (configuration is described in <<persistence_config>>).

Regardless of whether the database or file backend is used the entities are stored in binary format (blobs). There is a tool +dope_bin2xml+ (run with -h to get some brief help) that converts the binary blobs into xml, which is easier to read or manipulate. The xml is placed in the xmldata column of the database, or in a file with .xml as extension (the binaries are removed when this is done, so that there will be only one source of persistence data when starting the persistence service next time). When the persistence service starts, it first looks for xml data, and only when that is not found does it look for binary data.

This means that it is possible to run dope_bin2xml, edit the xml data, and then start the system to get the edited data presented as persistent data.

This also allows for a solution to a common problem: When a dou file is changed (a member is added or removed or an array length is changed) any old stored binary persistent data is unusable (this is because the binaries are interpreted directly using the dou-files, e.g. by jumping straight in and getting some specific bytes out for a certain member). But loading stored data in xml format is much more "compatible" with respect to dou-file changes, so if you run dope_bin2xml, then change the dou-files and recompile dots_generated, and then start the system you are much more likely to have usable data in the persistent entities.

This works with adding members, or changing array lengths, but not with removing or renaming members (unless they are _null_ in the persisted data, in which case they are not present in the xml). Of course if your persistent data is valuable, you can always edit the xml "by hand" to keep it. Just remember to do dope_bin2xml _before_ you change your Dob object definitions.

== Utilities

Safir SDK Core contains a few utilities to simplify some things.

=== Sending many requests
Although the Dob allows you to have several outstanding requests at a time (see also <<queue_lengths>>) it is sometimes desirable to be able to send off a bunch of requests and just get a summary of how it all went. Safir SDK Core provides a service for exactly this, Safir.Utilities.ForEach.

Foreach provides three Services:

Safir.Utilities.DeleteAllRequest::
        The purpose of this service is to delete all instances of a given entity. This comes handy if you want to delete entities without knowing their instanceId, e.g. for cleaning up.
Safir.Utilities.DeleteRequest::
        The purpose of this service is to delete a specified set of entities (fill an array with EntityIds).
Safir.Utilities.UpdateRequest::
        The purpose of this service is to update a bunch of entities accordingly to a template object. E.g. if you want to set a flag on a large number of entities you provide a template request and a list of EntityIds that you want the request applied to.

For each service you can choose which type of answer you want. _Immediate_, _Brief_ or _Full_. _Immediate_ means that you don't care if the operations are successful or not and you get this response immediately before all outstanding requests are finished. Brief waits for all operations to be finished before sending a response back. This information includes a summary of successful, non-successful and total operations. Full response is like Brief but you also get every single response from each operation in an array in the response.

The foreach service is provided by the "douf_foreach" executable, which needs to be running for the foreach requests to be serviced.

[[ace_dispatcher]]
=== Ace Dispatcher
For applications written in C\+\+ and using ACE the class +Safir.Utilities.AceDispatcher+ provides a +Dispatcher+ class that performs the thread switch and call to +Dispatch+ as described in <<dispatching>>.

Just instantiate the +AceDispatcher+ passing it your ACE_Reactor, and pass a pointer to the instance to your connection when calling +Open+, and you're done. The +AceDispatcher+ will now perform the thread switch through the reactor main loop using +notify+.

=== Time 
Under the namespace +Safir.Time+ there are a few classes that provide functionality for obtaining the current time (both local and UTC) and converting it to and from various formats.

The time library also has support for loading an external library at runtime which could provide a higher accuracy time. The full Safir SDK provides such a library, which provides a much higher accuracy multi-node synchronised clock than NTP can provide on both GNU/Linux or Windows based systems. For more information on this, contact Saab AB (contact information at http://www.safirsdk.com[]).

The correct way of managing overflow is to use the designated functions telling the caller when it is ok to perform the action again.

For example, if you get an overflow when sending a message (and that message should then be retried according to your application requirements/design) you can do something like this:

.Handling OverflowException
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
try
{
    m_connection.Send(myMessage,this);
}
catch (const Safir::Dob::OverflowException &)
{
    m_unsentMessage = myMessage;
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And then handle resending like this:

.Resending messages in OnNotMessageOverflow
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void MyMessageSender::OnNotMessageOverflow()
{
    try
    {
        m_connection.Send(m_unsentMessage,this);
        m_unsentMessage.reset(); //set the message to NULL
    }
    catch (const Safir::Dob::OverflowException &)
    {
        //don't do anything. We will be called again later
        //to resume sending the messages that have not yet been sent.
    }
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It might be tempting to use a list to keep the unsent messages in, but beware! The Dob design tries very hard to restrict queue sizes to be able to handle graceful degradation, don't ruin it by introducing infinite queues in your application! There might be cases when a queue of a _limited size_ may be applicable.

Note that the retry policy of your application _must_ be part of the requirements and design of the system and your application.

Another way to handle overflows, which applies if the message or request is sent as a result of a Dob subscription or request, is to use Postpone (see <<postpone>>). And in the case of operator requests you probably want a tellback to ask the operator to press the button again a little bit later.

There is a little bit more info on this in <<faq>>.

=== Type system freedoms
Since Messages, Entities, Items, and Services all inherits from Object, and it is possible to have members of the type Object, it is also possible to have Services as members in Items. And Entities as Service members etc.


=== Handling exceptions
There are two base classes for exceptions. +Safir.Dob.Typesystem.FundamentalException+ and +Safir.Dob.Typesystem.Exception+.
+Exceptions+ should be handled by the caller, but not +FundamentalExceptions+.

+FundamentalExceptions+ are programming errors that can be avoided. You should never add code that tries to handle your own programming errors. It is better if the application just dies, instead of limping along, better to detect the crash and restart the application (maybe after fixing it...)

==== Exceptions in callbacks
Letting an exception propagate out of a callback may cause your connection to the Dob to be corrupted in strange ways. You may loose messages, requests and entity subscription responses if you try to continue execution after this has occurred.

So catch all "expected" exceptions in the callbacks, but let all programming-error type exceptions propagate up to your main loop where you report the error and exit the program.

[[multithreading]]
=== Multithreading
A connection should only be used from within one thread. The queues and other states associated with a connection are not thread safe, for simplicity and efficiency. One thread can handle many connections, though.


[[hot_standby]]
=== Hot-standby / Redundancy
Using a combination of persistence and pending registrations (see <<persistence>> and <<pending_registrations>>, respectively) will let you support hot-standby and redundancy.

For an application to support redundancy the idea is that it is started in (at least) two instances, most likely on different computers in the system. At startup one is chosen as _active_, and the other(s) become _passive_. If the active instance fails (e.g. the application or the computer crashes, or the computer is shut down for maintenance) the Dob will detect that that computer has gone down, or that the application has crashed, and will tell one of the passive instances to become active.

To accomplish this, all the entities that the active instance maintained must be marked as persistent (at least volatile persistence), and one of the handlers, the "main" handler, must be registered using +RegisterEntityHandlerPending+.

When the +OnCompletedRegistration+ callback is invoked for the main handler, the rest of the handlers should be registered in the normal way (using overregistration) guaranteeing that one instance of the application has registered all handlers it is supposed to.

The first time the application instances start, one of the instances will be given the registration of the main handler (through a call to +OnCompletedRegistration+, which will lead it to register the other handlers as well. It will then receive any persisted entities through the +OnInjectedNewEntity+. When this instance terminates (due to a crash or something else) the Dob will detect that and call +OnCompletedRegistration+ on the other application instance, that will register the other handlers and receive the persisted entities. This will seamlessly cause the entity instances to move from one owner to another.

<<redundancy_sequence_diagram>> describes this as a sequence diagram, albeit without showing the part about registering the other handlers, since that would clutter up the diagram needlessly.

[[redundancy_sequence_diagram]]
.Sequence diagram for redundant entity handlers
image::images/redundancy_sequence_diagram.jpg["Redundancy Sequence Diagram", width=350, link="images/redundancy_sequence_diagram.jpg"]

Note that applications subscribing to the entities that are redundancy-handled _may_ see the entity instances as deleted for a short while, since in reality the handler was unregistered for a short while.

=== Entity reference gotchas
When using entities that are linked to each other through EntityId members there are a few things that you need to remember/handle in both the application that produces the entities and the applications that use them.

Applications that own the entities must make sure that no _orphans_ are left behind, and that incorrect dangling references are avoided. An example of orphaned entites is shown in <<orphan_example>>, where an entity uses another entity, a Location, to represent its position. If the entity is updated with a new location you must determine whether the old location is to be kept or not, to avoid cluttering the system with orphaned locations.

[[orphan_example]]
.Entities that may cause orphans.
image::images/orphan_object.jpg["Entities that may cause orphans", width=210]

For applications that use the entities that contain associations you need to be aware that the Dob does not guarantee the order in which entities are delivered to subscribers, and that while you're handling a subscription an associated entity may be removed, before you've managed to Read it.

There is no surefire way to handle all these cases, it must be decided on a case by case basis, but a first recommendation is to only subscribe to the "main" entities, and do Reads or temporary subscriptions to get the referred entities.

This also applies to applications that handle asynchronous injections, as described in <<systems_of_systems>>.

[[systems_of_systems]]
== Systems of Systems^adv^

This chapter contains information about how to write applications that support _Systems of Systems_, i.e. a number of Dob-systems communicating over some other media, using _asynchronous injections_.

The Dob itself relies on high reliability and high bandwidth LAN connections for its communication between nodes. Asynchronous injections makes it possible to create an application that links together multiple systems like this using a medium with low connectivity and low bandwidth (e.g. a legacy radio), or a medium with high bandwidth but non-optimal connectivity (e.g. the internet).

A complete description of how to build a system with asynchronous injections, or how to create an _injector_, i.e. an application that performs the injections, is outside the scope if this document, which will concentrate on how to write applications that can handle injections. If you're interested in more information on this than this document provides, please contact Saab AB at http://www.safirsdk.com/[].

But, we need a little bit of background to be able to understand the rest of this chapter:

To save on bandwidth injections are sent as _deltas_ over the network. Since some data may reach one system long before it reaches the others (might have been out of radio contact) all data is timestamped, and upon injection the data is merged using these timestamps, to ensure that all the "latest" data is what is used in all systems.

In a system of systems with low connectivity it is also possible that the same entity is being updated while the network is down, and the timestamps are also used to work out which data is the latest.

=== Injectable entities
An entity is configured to be _Injectable_ using the same configuration mechanism as persistence, as described in <<persistence>>, but using the +Injectable+ persistence type. Entities marked as +Injectable+ will have the behaviour of +SynchronousPermanent+ (and thus also of +SynchronousVolatile+) entities, with the added functionality that injections can occur throughout the lifetime of an entity, not just at registration-time.

[[asynchronous_injections]]
=== Asynchronous Injections
Asynchronous Injections are the kind of injection that can occur throughout the lifetime of an entity. The other use of injections is Persistence, as described in <<persistence>>, can only occur at _registration time_.

The first thing to mention is that if a type is marked as _Injectable_ its instances will be persisted, just as if it was marked as +SynchronousPermanent+. Note, however, that it is not the persistence service, dope_main, that performs the persistence in this case, but the _injector_, but this should be completely transparent for the user.

==== Using asynchronous injections
For an entity to support asynchronous injections, it must have the Safir.Dob.InjectionProperty mapped with a value of "Injectable", and the application must register it using +RegisterEntityHandlerInjection+ and an entity handler that implements the +EntityHandlerInjection+ consumer interface.

The +EntityHandlerInjection+ consumer interface has, as described in <<advanced_persistence>>, four callbacks more than the EntityHandler consumer interface: +OnInjectedNewEntity+, +OnInjectedUpdatedEntity+, +OnInjectedDeletedEntity+ and +OnInitialInjectionsDone+. These are the circumstances that the callbacks are invoked (the sequence is shown in <<injection_sequence_diagram>>):

+OnInjectedNewEntity+::
    - Immediately after registration for each persisted entity instance, just as for types marked for persistence.
    - Any time during the lifetime of an application if a _new instance is injected_ by the injector.
+OnInjectedUpdatedEntity+::
    When the injector injects some changes into an existing entity instance.
+OnInjectedDeletedEntity+::
    When the injector injects a delete. I.e. the instance is deleted on another system.
+OnInitialInjectionsDone+::
    After all persisted entity instances have been resurrected or rejected by an +OnInjectedNewEntity+ callback.


[[injection_sequence_diagram]]
.Injection sequence diagram
image::images/injection_sequence_diagram.jpg["Injection Sequence Diagram", width=350, link="images/injection_sequence_diagram.jpg"]


Note that it is not possible to tell the difference between the two kinds of calls to +OnInjectedNewEntity+, and in fact both new and old (i.e. persisted and injected) data can be mixed (i.e. timestamp merged) in a call to +OnInjectedNewEntity+.

When an application receives one of the injection callbacks it can either accept the injection, by just returning, or it can say that the injection is not complete (i.e. all deltas that are needed to make an entity that makes sense have not arrived yet) by calling +IncompleteInjectionState+ (see <<incomplete_injection_state>>) or it can explicitly delete the entity. What is important to note is that if the entity is deleted is that that will cause the delete to be sent to other systems (by the injector), so delete may not be a good idea.

For injections to work correctly it is important that applications use +SetChanges+ instead of +SetAll+ when modifying entities. This is because +SetChanges+ will use the change flags to work out which members should have the new and updated timestamp. In fact _always_ prefer +SetChanges+ to +SetAll+, it makes more sense w.r.t. change flags even in entities that are not injectable, and it will probably make it easier to add the possibility of handling injections at a later time to your application.

[[timestamp_merge]]
==== Timestamp merges
Each top-level member (note that it is _only_ the top-level members, not members in items or individual array items) have a timestamp that is used to determine which bits of information is "newest". 

*Note:* This fact gives constraints on the design of objects that are to be used with asynchronous injections. They will probably have to be quite "shallow".

The timestamps are based on a normal concept of time, but have an additional feature to make them better adjusted to use when the clocks on different systems (in a system of systems) "drift": When updating an entity instance the time used for timestamps is the maximum of "my own time" and "the highest time I've seen from other systems, plus one". This solves problems in systems with wildly diverging system times. (The timestamps can be thought of as Lamport timestamps, but with the always moving along with the UTC time, not only when there is an event.)

An example of how timestamp merges work is probably the best way to explain the algorithm:

In <<ts_merge_1>> an application owns an entity (and has done a single +SetChanges+ at time 100). The entity has been reflected to other systems by the Injector.

[[ts_merge_1]]
.Timestamp merge, initial entity
[grid="all"]
`---------`-------------`---------
Member    Timestamp     Value
----------------------------------
0         100           Foo
1         100           _Null_
2         100           Bar
3         100           _Null_
----------------------------------

On another system (at time 110) the application does a +SetChanges+ with Member 0 set to "hello" and Member 1 set to "33". This will cause the injector on "our" system to make the injection shown in <<ts_merge_2>>.

[[ts_merge_2]]
.Timestamp merge, first injection
[grid="all"]
`---------`-------------`-------------`---------
Member    IsChanged     Timestamp     Value
------------------------------------------------
0         *True*        *110*         *hello*
1         *True*        *110*         *33*
2         False         0             _Null_
3         False         0             _Null_
------------------------------------------------

This will be merged with the current entity (again, on "our" system) into the object in <<ts_merge_3>>.

[[ts_merge_3]]
.Timestamp merge, merged object
[grid="all"]
`---------`-------------`-------------`---------
Member    IsChanged     Timestamp     Value
------------------------------------------------
0         *True*        *110*         *hello*
1         *True*        *110*         *33*
2         False         100           Bar
3         False         100           _Null_
------------------------------------------------

This merged object will be presented to the application through a call to +OnInjectedUpdatedEntity+ with the change flags set as indicated, and if the application accepts that injection (by just returning) the entity instance shown in <<ts_merge_4>> will be set in the Dob (and shown to subscribers or readers).

[[ts_merge_4]]
.Timestamp merge, resultant entity
[grid="all"]
`---------`-------------`---------
Member    Timestamp     Value
----------------------------------
0         110           hello
1         110           33
2         100           Bar
3         100           _Null_
----------------------------------

While all this was happening, a third system (at time 105) the application did a SetChanges with Member 0 set to "Lemon" and Member 3 set to "Curry". On our system the injector will then do the injection shown in <<ts_merge_5>> (but note that this delta arrives to our system after the 110-delta).


[[ts_merge_5]]
.Timestamp merge, another injection
[grid="all"]
`---------`-------------`-------------`---------
Member    IsChanged     Timestamp     Value
------------------------------------------------
0         *True*        *105*         *Lemon*
1         False         0             _Null_
2         False         0             _Null_
3         *True*        *105*         *Curry*
------------------------------------------------

Which will be merged with the current entity to become the object shown in <<ts_merge_6>>


[[ts_merge_6]]
.Timestamp merge, second merge result
[grid="all"]
`---------`-------------`-------------`---------
Member    IsChanged     Timestamp     Value
------------------------------------------------
0         False         110           hello
1         False         110           33
2         False         100           bar
3         *True*        *105*         *Curry*
------------------------------------------------

This object will be presented to the application and, if accepted, will be set into the Dob and shown to subscribers and readers.

At this stage all systems will have the exact same entity, since the timestamp merge is completely predictable, regardless of the order that the deltas arrive.

[[incomplete_injection_state]]
==== IncompleteInjectionState
The method +IncompleteInjectionState+ (can be found in the +ConnectionAspectPostpone+ aspect) can be used if an application thinks that an asynchronous injection (in one of the injection callbacks) is missing some information which should be injected "soon". Since entities are updated as deltas it is possible that two deltas arrive in the "wrong order" (due to bad or low connectivity). The application may be able to detect this, and decide that it wants to wait for more entity information. A call to IncompleteInjectionState will cause the injection to be held back until another injection is received for the same instance, when the merged injections will be presented to the application again.

== Test support and Tools
Safir SDK Core contains some tools that are useful for, among other things, application and system testing.

[[sate]]
=== Sate
There is an application in Safir SDK Core, Sate (stands for _Safir Application Tester_), which is very useful for testing applications that use the Dob. In short it is a GUI application that allows you to perform most operations that the Dob provides interactively.

For example, you can set up a subscription to an entity, register entity handlers and set entity instances. You can subscribe to and send messages etc. This can be very useful for interacting with an application, for example before the real HSI is implemented fully, or pretending to be another application that your application communicates with.

<<sate_overview>> shows Sate with the Safir.Application.BackdoorCommandMessage opened. All the Dob classes are listed in the left sidebar, where you can right-click to get operations you can do on the types. The right sidebar contains operations you can do on the object opened.

[[sate_overview]]
.Sate screen shot
image::images/sate_overview.jpg["Sate Screen shot", width=400, link="images/sate_overview.jpg"]

The lower left part is an "inbox", containing the most recent entity updates and requests, service requests and messages received. The lower right hand part shows a history of what "has happened", e.g. showing if a request has been successfully sent, etc.

[[dobexplorer]]
=== Dobexplorer
Dobexplorer is a tool that is primarily meant for the developers of the Dob, but it has some features that are useful for users of the Safir SDK Core too. New features are added to dobexplorer as they are needed by the Dob developers.

<<dobexplorer_memory>> shows dobexplorer displaying a graph of the shared memory usage of the Dob. (The amount of memory available is configured in Safir.Dob.NodeParameters, where you also have to look to find out what 100% means.)

== Appendix A: Example applications
Along with the Safir SDK Core you should have received some example applications that show how to create a small application that will give you a starting point for your own applications.

[[faq]]
== Appendix C: FAQ
Why do I get IllegalValueExceptions when sending message/request or setting an entity???
  Most likely because you've got a string in your object that is longer than what is specified by the +maxLength+ field in your dou-file. For various reasons the string lengths are not checked until the object is "handed" to the Dob. This means that if you put a string which is 100 characters long into a message member that has +maxLength+ 10 you will not get the error until you call +Send+.
+
Remember that you can check the value of maxLength programmatically by calling +<member name>MaxStringLength()+ on your class (e.g. +Safir::Dob::ErrorResponse::AdditionalInfoMaxStringLength()+ to get the max length of the member AdditionalInfo).

How are the callbacks invoked???
  When something occurs that an application may be interested in knowing about the Dob signals an event internally that results in a call to the +OnDoDispatch()+ callback. The application now has to _switch threads_ to the thread that owns the connection and call +Dispatch()+. The Dispatch call will in turn call all the required callbacks (e.g. OnMessage if a message has been received). Note that a dispatch may be triggered without actually resulting in any callbacks.

Can I trust IsCreated???
  IsCreated can really only be trusted by the entity instance owner. All other applications can get true in one statement, and then get an exception (due to timing) on the next, where they to try to read the contents of an instance.

Why does dope_main crash at startup???
  Chances are that you have changed you dou-files, and that the persisted data is no longer valid. There is a solution to this, which is outlined in <<persistence_service>>, but of course you can just delete the persistent data by removing the files or clearing the database table contents.

What do I do with the +ResponseSender+ when I'm postponing a request???
  If you're postponing with the +redispatchCurrent+ flag set to true you need to call +Discard+ on the ResponseSender, otherwise it will get upset that you're not sending a response and cause your application to report an error and maybe crash.
 
Why have overflows???
  One of the main design focuses of the Dob has been to facilitate creating systems that degrade gracefully, and the overflow mechanism is a result of this. When a Dob-based system comes under heavy load some data will be discarded (due to overflows), which ensures that there is an upper limit to the amount of memory and CPU used. If the Dob had not used the overflow mechanism, but instead had ``infinite queues'', more and more memory would be consumed, which would lead to more and more CPU load, and eventually to a crash or some other undefined behaviour.
+
This of course means that your application should not introduce infinite queues of its own, since that would reintroduce the ungraceful degradation problem. There is a little bit more information in <<overflow_handling>>.

Why shouldn't I have an infinite queue in my application to avoid overflows???
  This is described somewhat in <<overflow_handling>>, and the FAQ entry above.
