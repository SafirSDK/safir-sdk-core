A few of the images in here are created from diagrams in the Enterprise Architect file sug_diagrams.eap.
The process of getting them to the state they're now (png:s and jpg:s) is as follows:

1. Open a diagram in the eap file
2. Choose Diagram->Save Image...
3. Save as a png file
4. Open the png in your favorite editor and crop it to remove the "frame"
5. Save as both png and jpg (see below)

The sequence diagrams are created in a model file that is not publicly available.

Why both png and jpg?
I had trouble with asciidoc and pngs, so even though png is a much better format (non-lossy compression, transparency etc) I was forced to convert them to jpgs. If at some stage the png problem is fixed we probably want to go back to pngs. So keep both a png and a jpg of each image...
