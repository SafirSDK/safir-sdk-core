;Control whether logs are sent to the native operating system logging mechanism. On Linux
;this is the syslog(...) function, and on Windows the logs will be put in the Windows
;Event Log.

;The address that syslog message will be sent to if send_to_syslog_server is true.

;Some syslog daemons will truncate logs containing newlines. This setting makes Safir
;Logging replace newlines with a space.

;Truncate syslog messages after this many bytes. RFC3164 states that 1024 is the limit,
;but many syslog servers allow for longer messages. Make sure to verify that changing
;this works with your server. This only applies to syslog messages, not to native logging.

;Show the current SAFIR_INSTANCE in syslog reports. This is very useful when running
;multiple Safir instances on the same computer.

[LowLevelLog]
;Set the log level that will be used upon startup. This can be set when logging needs to
;be turned on by default.  If you just want to change logging level in runtime you can
;use logger_control or dobexplorer.

;Directory where the logs are put.

;Ignore flushes, and write only when buffer is full. Setting this option to true reduces
;logging overhead, but can cause unflushed log output to be lost on crashes.
ignore_flush=false

;Control whether timestamps on are added to each line in the logs. Setting this option to
;false reduces logging overhead.
