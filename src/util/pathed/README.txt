The code in this directory generates a tool called "pathed", which is used by
the Safir SDK Core installer to manipulate the PATH environment variable.

Pathed is a tool that is part of GTools that can be found at 
http://p-nand-q.com/download/gtools/index.html.

The code in this directory comes from version 4.2 of GTools, and has been 
modified slightly to make it compile as a standalone tool.
