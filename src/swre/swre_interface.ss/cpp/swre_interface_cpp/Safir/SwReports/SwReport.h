/**

Provides methods for sending sofware reports.

There are five predefined report types:

    - Fatal Error Report
    - Error Report
    - Resource Report
    - Program Info report
    - Programming Error Report

See the corresponding method for a description of the intended usage.

Some methods have both an error code and a text parameter (both of type string).
The intended usage is that the error code parameter should be a short mnemonic string
and the text parameter should be a more elaborated description. The mnemonic strings
are preferably defined as Dob parameters.

From the location parameter string it should be easy to identify the exact code location
where the report is generated.

All methods are thread safe.

@deprecated use Safir::Logging::SendSystemLog() instead.
