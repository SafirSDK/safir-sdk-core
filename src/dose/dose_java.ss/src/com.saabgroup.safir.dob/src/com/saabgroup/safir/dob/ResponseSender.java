/**
 * Class used for responding to received requests.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to allow responses to be sent either from
 * within the request callback, or at a later time (in which case you have
 * to keep the responseSender you received in the callback "for later").
 *
 * Note that you still have to send the response within the timout period,
 * or the response will not be delivered to the requestor (who will have
 * received a timeout response instead).
 *
 * Not using a ResponseSender is considered a programming error, if it not
 * used a log will be emitted when the object is being finalized.
 * Since the finalizer is called by the Garbage Collector this may happen 
 * "long after" you've dropped your reference to the response sender.
