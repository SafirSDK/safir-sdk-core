 * Class that provides a methods to postpone the reception of data from the Dob.

 * received in callbacks from the Dob.
 *
 * For instance, setting up a subscription can potentially give a lot of initial OnNewEntity callbacks.
 * If the application, for each subscription response, sends a request, the out-queue will probably fill up
 * giving an Overflow exception. In this situation the application can postpone further callbacks.

     * Postpone dispatching of current callback method for the dispatched type and its subclasses.
     *
     * Used by a consumer to postpone dispatching of current callback method for the dispatched type and its subclasses.
     *
     * This method can be called from within the following callbacks:
     * @li EntitySubscriber#OnNewEntity
     * @li EntitySubscriber#OnUpdatedEntity
     * @li EntitySubscriber#OnDeletedEntity
     * @li EntityInjectionBase#OnInjectedNewEntity
     * @li EntityInjectionBase#OnInjectedUpdatedEntity
     * @li EntityInjectionBase#OnInjectedDeletedEntity
     * @li EntityRequestBase#OnCreateRequest
     * @li EntityRequestBase#OnUpdateRequest
     * @li EntityRequestBase#OnDeleteRequest
     * @li ServiceRequestBase#OnServiceRequest
     * @li MessageSubscriber#OnMessage
     *
     * but NOT from the following callbacks:
     * @li RevokedRegistrationBase#OnRevokedRegistration
     * @li CompletedRegistrationBase#OnCompletedRegistration
     * @li EntityInjectionBase#OnInitialInjectionsDone
     * @li StopHandler#OnStopOrder
     * @li Dispatcher#OnDoDispatch
     * @li Requestor#OnResponse
     * @li Requestor#OnNotRequestOverflow
     * @li MessageSender#OnNotMessageOverflow
     * @li RegistrationSubscriber#OnRegistered
     * @li RegistrationSubscriber#OnUnregistered
     *
     * The dispatching is automatically resumed when an OnNotRequestOverflow or OnNotMessageOverflow is
     * dispatched to the application which means that the application doesn't need to invoke ResumePostponed()
     * by itself when the original postpone has been made because of an overflow situation.
     *
     * Note that the postpone only applies to the currently dispatching consumer, other consumers will not
     * be affected by the postpone.
     *
     * If you are postponing a request (OnCreateRequest, OnUpdateRequest, OnDeleteRequest or OnServiceRequest),
     * special care must be taken to the handling of the ResponseSender object. If redispatchCurrent is to True
     * the current ResponseSender must be discarded (you will get a new ResponseSender). If redispatchCurrent
     * is set to False a response for the current request must be sent.
     *
     * @param redispatchCurrent True indicates that the currently dispatched object shall be dispatched again
     *                               once the dispatching is resumed.
