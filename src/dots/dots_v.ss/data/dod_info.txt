SECTION: One of "Parameters", "Parent" and "Code"

Parameters
==========
The parameter section contains information for Dots_V. There are some fix parameters:
    File_Extension:"cs"
    Filename_Separator:"."
    Output_Directory:"dotnet\"
    Namespace_Separator:"."
    Object_Type:"object"
    Index_Type:"int32"

Types are defined like this:
    Type:<dou>:<set/get>:"<generated>"
E.g.:
    Type:string:String:"Safir::Dots::String":"dots/dots_defs"
    defines "string" as a typename in the xml-syntax (dou-file).
    And "String" to be the @_UNIFORM_ELEMENTTYPE_@, used in the name of Set/Get routines.
    And "Safir::Dots::String" to be used where the actual type is needed in the code.
    And that "dots/dots_defs" (without file extension) is to be included due to this.

Parent
======
Declared if there is a need to create parental files.
