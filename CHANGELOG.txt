Safir SDK Core 3.2.2.1 is a backport release that contains fixes for some important bugs that have been found in upstream development. 

Changes since Safir SDK Core 3.2.2:
===================================
* Fixed a potential deadlock situation which could occur during the pool distribution phase when connecting a node.

* Improved handling of entity states received from other node.

* Improved lock handling. Before, dose_main could in some situations end up in a deadlock.

* Fixed a bug that caused the dispatcher thread (and thus the application) to terminate when running on systems with Linux kernel 2.6.22 or earlier.
